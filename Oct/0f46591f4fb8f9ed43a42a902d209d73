TV presenter and entrepreneur Sbusiso “DJ Sbu” Leope is returning to South African TV screens as the host of SABC1’s reality show called Future Leaders. Future Leaders aims to help young entrepreneurs to reach their goals and equip them to be better leaders. The show was previously presented by Tumelo Mothotoane. Leope was fired three years ago while promoting his energy drink Mofaya at the Metro FM music awards. Leope told City Press that he was head-hunted after they saw the work he did with his foundation, the Sbusiso Leope Education Foundation. “The SABC has always been my home. It is a great feeling to be back and my dream to be back on TV doing what I love, which is presenting,” he said. Leope has another show in the pipeline. It is named after his book, Billionaires Under Construction. However, he refused to give details about the show. Following his 2014 release, Lengoma, Leope is back with a new single, Vum Vum – honouring the late kwaito star Brown Dash. The single has already received airplay. Vum Vum features Nigerian superstar Patoranking and DJ Maphorisa, and is a revamp of Brow Dash’s hit single featuring kwaito stars Brickz and Mdu. “With the money I will be getting from the song, I’ll be helping to fund Brown Dash children’s education. It is my responsibility to make sure that his legacy lives on,” he said. “My focus has always been on entrepreneurship, leadership and empowering young people at schools around our country,” he said, adding that he finds peace in helping young people to get where they want to be in life. Leope is confident that South African youth have the potential to be whatever they want to be in life, but most of them fail to chase their dreams because of a lack of funding. • Catch Future Leaders on SABC 1 at 9pm on Tuesdays.
