South Africa’s first premium flavoured beer Flying Fish has always been a great addition to a relaxed summer day. Now they’ve launched a new variant that’s a lighter version of the original with less kilojoules, calories and less alcohol percentage – Flying Fish Chill. With it, Flying Fish is trying to show Mzansi that you don’t always have to drink to get drunk. In fact, Flying Fish Chill can be a great addition to a healthy lifestyle. For the launch of the new Chill, the brand took over the Urban Yard in Bryanston and launched a concept like no other: beer yoga. Yup, you heard that right! Guests arrived early Sunday morning in their yoga gear, where 5FM’s DJ Fix was ready to MC the event, while fitness personality Khabonina kick started the launch with a yoga session. Guests drank Flying Fish Chill as they stretched and worked out, even making the bottle part of the workout! One of the event’s most enjoyed experience was the silent disco party by DJ Ashley and Deep Ancestral. Here relaxed guests were given Bluetooth headsets that allowed them to tune in and out of their DJ of preference, as they danced away to what seemed like silence. Then dance songbird Shekhinah closed off the morning with her best hits from her latest album titled Rose Gold. Drinking in moderation is the new trend in Johannesburg, and Flying Fish Chill is the perfect beverage to help you do it.
