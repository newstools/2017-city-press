Thurgood Marshall was a pioneer when it came to law in the United States. Not only was he the country’s first African-American Supreme Court justice and an incredible civil rights advocate, but his argument in the Brown vs Board of Education resulted in separate public schools for black and white students being declared unconstitutional. Directed by Reginald Hudlin (The Boondocks and Django Unchained), Marshall is a film that explores one of Thurgood Marshall’s (Chadwick Boseman – Black Panther star) greatest challenges as a young attorney – the case of black chauffeur Joseph Spell (Sterling K Brown), accused by his white employer, Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson), of sexual assault and attempted murder in 1941. This was long before Marshall sat on the US Supreme Court or claimed victory in Brown vs Board of Education. The Spell case lands Marshall in the wealthy white enclaves of Connecticut, where racism is never far from the surface. Angry picketers and tabloid headlines scream for Spell’s conviction as black servants are fired by their fearful white employers. Marshall’s attempt to fight for his client is thwarted by Judge Colin Foster (James Cromwell), who allows him to attend the trial, but not speak. This leaves the defence in the shaky hands of Samuel Friedman (Josh Gad), who has no interest in trying this case. Largely forgotten by history, The State of Connecticut vs Joseph Spell helped lay the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement to come, and informed the legal doctrine of one of America’s greatest jurists. • City Press is hosting a screening of Marshall for readers based in Johannesburg at Sandton on Thursday.
