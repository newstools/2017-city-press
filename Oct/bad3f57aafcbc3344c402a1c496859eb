President Jacob Zuma’s close ally Dudu Myeni has been removed as chairperson of ailing parastatal South African Airways (SAA). Myeni’s removal comes in the wake of mounting pressure from lenders of the national carrier, with claims that she has been at the centre of instability. City Press understands that Myeni will be replaced by Johannes Bhekumuzi Magwaza. He will be deputised by Nolitha Fakude. It’s understood that others who could join the board include Geoff Rothschild, Ahmed Bassa, Tinyiko Mhlari and Martin Kingston. Sources say board members Tryphosa Mmakeaya, Mzimkhulu Malunga, Siphile Buthelezi, Nazmeera Moola and Gugu Sipamla, would all be getting the axe. Those who will be retained are believed to be Swazi Tshabalala, Peter Tshisevhe, Thandeka Mgoduso, Pieter Maluleka and Akhter Moosa. It’s hoped that the new additions who come from business and finance sectors would be enough to appease investors and stabilise the embattled airline. It’s expected that an official announcement would be made by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba early on Thursday morning.
