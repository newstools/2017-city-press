If high performance speed is your thing, you’ll need to be at the BMW M Festival at Kyalami this weekend. By Melinda Ferguson I’ve always loved sneak previews but nothing touched the media invitation I cracked the nod to yesterday, of the inaugural BMW M Festival that kicks off tomorrow and runs till the end of the weekend at Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit in Midrand. The media day was a hotbed of snarls and growls as a breathtaking adrenaline-infused range of BMW M performance models were set loose on a sweltering track. The highlight was the unveiling of the new BMW M4 CS. With its state-of-the-art TwinPower Turbo technology, the speed demon races from 0-100kms in a cool 3.9 seconds, while its 3.0-litre high-performance engine emits 338kWs of breathtaking power . The top speed of the M4 CS, which comes as standard with the M Driver’s Package, is electronically limited to 280km/h. But that’s not all. Petrolheads are in for a treat this weekend as BMW customers, fans and car enthusiasts will get a sneak preview of current and upcoming BMW M models, experience hot laps and book test drives across the BMW M as well as M Performance model range. There’ll be plenty of opportunity to do drag racing and drifting as well as view a whole range of brand new and classic Beamers in the showrooms. Live music by the hippest top DJs and artists will entertain the crowds while gourmet food and drinks are on sale for the hungry and thirsty. An additional highlight at the BMW M Festival will be the presence of the BMW DTM race team, Team Schnitzer with driver Tom Blomqvist making a guest appearance. For a once in a life time speed experience, visitors can enjoy hot laps in the BMW M4 DTM car around the 16-turn, 4.522km anti-clockwise FIA graded circuit. A day pass starts at R150.
