Audiences aren’t showing up to watch local dance film Pop, Lock ‘n Roll, which will be in cinemas till Sunday. So we’ve compiled a list of 5 reasons why you should go see it: 1. The dancing is on par with that in international movies The level of talent from the dancers in this movie can compete with that seen on international films. The choreographers, which include Craig Bullock and Dotcom, have created some really slick pieces and it’s a strong point of the film. 2. The lead actors can actually act Lead actors Maurice Paige (Raps) and Yasirah Bhelz (Queen) are funny and charming in this film. They play characters who are two worlds apart but end up falling in love against all odds. This is a narrative we have become accustomed to across several genres. 3. It’s a wonderful showcase for South Africa The film showcases Cape Town’s vibrant culture, and South Africa as a whole, positively. They display the South African flag in creative ways, like the deejay booth where the dance crews perform and also on the rooftop where they practice their dance routines. It makes you feel patriotic! Heavy violence, politics and apartheid are the usual themes of South African movies. It was refreshing to have a film that still represents local culture, language and heritage in a positive way. 4. Touches on the negative effects of gangs In the movie, Raps is an ambitious dancer who aspires to get out of his hometown Westbury, which is plagued by gangsterism and crime. Gun violence and regular drive-by shootings result in him fearing for the life of his only son. The high crime rates and gang life is a reality for many South Africans, and this film manages to highlight those issues. 5. The production is slick The production value of the film is of a high calibre. Unlike many local films, the way in which the film was edited does not feel amateurish or like the production had a low budget. Watch the trailer here:
