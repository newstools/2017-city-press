The effects of poverty, inequality and youth unemployment continue to pose challenges as we advance in our democracy. These socioeconomic problems have to be addressed and policy solutions found, either to eliminate them or reduce their severity. In this regard policymakers plan policy interventions that seek to address these problems. Informed by conceptual thinking that says: “If we provide a programme in this specific way, targeting this type of beneficiary it will bring about this outcome.” Public programmes are then devised and implemented. These policy interventions come to life through the implementation of public programmes within the machinery of government. We then see public programmes such as the child support grant as part of the social protection system, the proposed youth wage subsidy, that seeks to find solutions to the endemic youth unemployment challenge and the upgrading of informal settlements programme that seeks to meet social housing needs. How can we know that government programmes actually work? Evaluation of the impact of programmes is important. The “impact agenda” calls for impact evaluations that are relevant to policy-making, that communicate evidence and provides clear policy direction. It encourages progress from the monitoring of programme outputs, towards the evaluation of outcomes and impact. This has resulted in the focus on programme impact evaluation, driven by calls for evidence of what works for whom, why, how, when and under what circumstances. Why is it important to demonstrate impact? There is now new emerging thinking regarding the effectiveness of public policies and programmes, in terms of their relevance, their performance, “value for taxpayer money” and sustainable impact. In this regard we need to go beyond measuring programme outputs and rather detail the outcomes and impact of the interventions on a long and sustainable basis.
