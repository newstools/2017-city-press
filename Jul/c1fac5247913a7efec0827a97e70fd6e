World-famous entrepreneur and author Robert Kiyosaki has predicted that markets worldwide, including South Africa, are headed for a crash and there isn&rsquo;t much countries can do about it.Kiyosaki, addressing the media shortly before attending the launch of Step Up 2 A Start Up programme at Montecasino on Thursday evening, said economies worldwide were spiralling and the only winner would be the wealthy people.&ldquo;We are in a crash right now, where you see the rand dropping, and my concern is it&rsquo;s not going to stop,&rdquo; he said, adding that more people needed to learn how wealthy people used tax, debts, charity and laws to make themselves richer. An economic crash would also benefit the rich because assets go up for sale when there is a crash.The 70-year-old Kiyosaki said controlling one&rsquo;s cash flow was of utmost importance because an income statement was the equivalent of an adult&rsquo;s school report card and that there was no such thing as a disadvantaged child but rather a bad teacher.&ldquo;You have to make mistakes because learning is physical, not mental. That&rsquo;s why lawyers and doctors have what they call a practice, in science it&rsquo;s called an experiment, in theatre it&rsquo;s called rehearsal ... you have to make mistakes,&rdquo; said Kiyosaki, who rose to international stardom when he wrote the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad two decades ago.&ldquo;I have a huge ego and I am Japanese but it doesn&rsquo;t look good in a Toyota that&rsquo;s why I drive Ferraris and Lamborghinis and Rolls Royces,&rdquo; said the self-confessed friend of current United States President, Donald Trump.Promoting his latest book, which is dedicated to St Andrews College in Grahamstown, Kiyosaki said it was a grave injustice that schools didn&rsquo;t teach about money since everything boiled down to money. Later addressing an audience that included Gauteng Premier David Makhura, Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu and Primestars Managing Director Martin Sweet, whose company was the host, Kiyosaki went on to conduct a presentation on the types of education needed to make entrepreneurship work for society.
