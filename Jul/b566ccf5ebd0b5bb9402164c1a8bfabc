An emotional Dr Albertina Luthuli, daughter of the late Chief Albert Luthuli, has called for an inquest to investigate her father&rsquo;s death. Speaking in Groutville, north of Durban, on Friday at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the passing of Africa&rsquo;s first Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and one of the country&rsquo;s most respected struggle stalwarts, Luthuli said: &ldquo;As a family we are still in pain and finding closure is difficult.&rdquo;Inkosi Luthuli was killed in a freak train accident at his home in Groutville on July 21 1967 in mysterious circumstances. She said the recent opening of the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid stalwart Ahmed Timol gave the family some hope that they could finally get an opportunity to have her father&rsquo;s mysterious death reopened.KZN Premier Willies Mchunu responded to the plea from the family in making a call to President Jacob Zuma to revive the investigation into Luthuli&rsquo;s death. The commemoration ceremony held under the theme &lsquo;Unity in action and unity of purpose&rsquo;, was to honour, remember and celebrate the life and legacy of the country&rsquo;s liberation struggle giant and former icon. - Staff Reporter
