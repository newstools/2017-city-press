Former president Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s widow, Gra&ccedil;a Machel, has threatened to sue Mandela&rsquo;s doctor Vejay Ramlakan over his newly released book, Mandela&rsquo;s Last Years.Ramlakan reportedly details Mandela&rsquo;s last years, including intimate moments prior to his death. Machel has slammed the book, saying it is degrading and tarnishes the image of the struggle icon.&ldquo;I condemn [the] book in the strongest terms. It is an affront to and an assault on the trust and dignity of my late husband ... It breaches the doctor&ndash;patient relationship of confidentiality and I am taking legal advice on whether to institute legal proceedings against the author and its publisher. I will be consulting with executors Justice Dikgang Moseneke, George Bizos SC and Judge [Themba] Sangoni on how best to protect Madiba&rsquo;s good name and reputation,&rdquo; she said in a statement released by her foundation on Friday.Ramlakan is South Africa&rsquo;s former surgeon-general and headed Mandela&rsquo;s medical team till his death in 2013. Some echoed Machel&rsquo;s sentiments and took to Twitter to express their dissatisfaction.@Anele @RealTalkOn3 please try and get #VejayRamlakan author of #MandelasLastYears on the show. My heart broke reading the extract. pic.twitter.com/qTJycyPWKW If I were a patient of #VejayRamlakan , I would not rest easy. #RespectOurElders #GracaMachel @G_MachelTrust @HPCSA_ Graca Machel is thinking of going after Vejay Ramlakan. Makes sense to me ???????????? Moseneke described the book titled,Mandela's Last Years, by Vejay Ramlakan as 'distasteful if not unlawful'. #SABCNEWS Hayi bo is Let.Gen. Vejay Ramlakan even allowed to write about such? Hayi kukho abantu abangena buhle ngaphakathi Konje, has Lt. Gen Vejay Ramlakan (ret) answered for his role in Nkandla rot, before jumping into Madiba related issues!? If not, then ??
