Rapper Kiernan Forbes, known by his stage name AKA, spent his 67 minutes for Mandela Day with kids at Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg. The event – organised by Rockstart, the AKA Foundation and Constitutional Hill to honour 267 orphans – saw performances from AKA as well as rapper Sizwe “Reason” Moeketsi. “Mandela Day is one of the most important days in our calendar,” said AKA. He said they wanted to inspire young kids because they are the future leaders of this country. “I am here to uplift them by giving back and also giving my time to them,” he said. “I am living my dreams because of Mandela; that is why I am giving my time to the young ones,” he added. Reason said: “I am very grateful to be with these kids and also see the smiling which is a good thing.” The rapper performed some of his greatest hits, such as Bump the Cheese Up and Celebrity.
