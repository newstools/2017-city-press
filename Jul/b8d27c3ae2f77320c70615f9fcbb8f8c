Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has dissolved the school governing body (SGB) of Klipspruit-West Secondary School in Eldorado Park, saying a headmaster should be appointed regardless of race.This follows a protest at the school this week over the appointment of a black principal which resulted in pupils being unable to attend class. Angry parents barred them from entering the school, saying that it was a coloured area and there was not enough coloured representation. Lesufi met with members of the SGB, parents and community members and said that no one in the school had indicated a problem with the process that was followed to appoint a principal.The meeting with SGB #Klipspruit-Wes Secondary is currently underway.

He is yet to make a decision following the appointment of a new principal.
