President Jacob Zuma has faced a lot in his decade-long ANC presidency. He smiled at his rivals in Polokwane to become the ruling party&rsquo;s number one, he nosed his way into the hearts of the faithful to win re-election in Mangaung, and he stared at a motion of no confidence vote and forced it to blink. He did all this while smiling and laughing. Fear might have many faces but Zuma&rsquo;s is not one of them.His visage was on full display during the first four days of the ANC&rsquo;s national policy conference.
