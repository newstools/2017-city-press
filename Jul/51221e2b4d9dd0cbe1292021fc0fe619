As part of the festival, Sundance TV is turning the Franschhoek town hall in Huguenot Road into a movie house, showing acclaimed films such as Woodpeckers, Free and Easy, and School Life. Sundance TV, which started broadcasting on DStv in June this year on channel 108, is famous for screening the best independent art house and cinema nouveau films. Movie viewings will be free on a first-come-first-served basis for over-18-year-olds. Each moviegoer will also receive a glass of Franschhoek wine and a box of truffle-salted popcorn before the show begins. Yum!
