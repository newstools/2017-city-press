We were devastated when we heard that some of these couples were calling it a day. From Melanie and Zwai Bala to  Trevor and Lucille Gumbi, here are the breakups that had us sobbing over our morning coffee. Melanie and Zwai Bala When radio presenter Melanie Bala and her husband, Zwai, released a joint statement confirming that divorce proceedings were under way, I was really touched and felt as if I knew them personally. Since the release of their joint statement the couple, who got married in 2008, have refused to do any interviews and have since asked to be given privacy.  Robert Marawa and Pearl Thusi You first heard it from us in City Press in May when we reported that sports broadcaster Robert Marawa appeared to have blocked his fiancée, actress Pearl Thusi, on Twitter. It was only in August when Marawa finally confirmed their split on his Twitter account. He wrote: “The rumour and speculation that our relationship with Miss Pearl Thusi ended a few months ago. We continue to be good friends though.”  Unathi and Thomas Msengana Rumours were circulating since August, that the Idols judge and former Metro FM DJ, Unathi, and her husband Thomas “Bad Boy T” Msengana’s marriage was on the rocks. They confirmed their separation two months later.  Thembi Seete and Bobo Seritsane Thembi Seete and Bobo “Bo” Seritsane had been together for over a decade and got engaged in 2012. They were once inseparable and no one saw it coming that one day they would go their separate ways.
