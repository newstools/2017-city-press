Molemo “Jub Jub” Maarohanye is making his path in the music industry again and giving back to communities after he was released on parole earlier this year. Maarohanye and his accomplice Themba Tshabalala had crashed their Mini Coopers into a group of schoolboys in Protea North, Soweto, on March 8 2010 during a drag race. They were released on parole in January this year. Maarohanye recently released his third single titled Awesome God, which is a follow-up from Shooting Star. In Awesome God he features new kid on the block, Bonokuhle Nkala, with her sweet, smooth voice that goes well with his rap style. “This song is close to my heart and it is also a way for me to share my story with society through it,” Maarohanye said. The 37-year-old told City Press that it was always his dream to work with a female artist on his songs. “Bonokuhle is an amazing singer and songwriter. She was always on time when we produced this song,” he said. The muso has been in studio putting together the album that he promised his fans he would drop on September 3. The Ndikhokhele hitmaker didn’t manage to release the album though because he was busy with motivational talks at schools and also giving back to communities. Maarohanye said he was still grateful for the second chance given to him. “It takes a man of great character to admit when he has lost his way and seek God’s intervention to make him a better being,” he said. The challenges that affect us as people can either make or break us, he said, but with every loss there is a lesson to be learned. “If you have ever gone through anything deep and challenging in your life, this song will heal you,” he said. He is currently promoting his single around the country. He is also planning on releasing his album in February.
