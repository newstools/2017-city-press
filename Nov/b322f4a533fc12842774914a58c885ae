As the partnership between LaLiga and the KwaMahlobo Games continues, Africa director for LaLiga, Antonio Barradas, says South Africa was chosen as a partner because of a “better development structure” compared with other African countries. “LaLiga has offices in Lagos in Nigeria but personally, I love South Africa. “I believe we have all the facilities here, we have everything. When you want to start something you have to start where there is everything like [proper development structure],” Barradas said. He said that when LaLiga eventually went to other African countries it would have a great foundation. He was speaking at the launch of 21st edition of KwaMahlobo Games in Soweto on Tuesday. The draw for Under-13, men’s and women’s games was conducted by former Bafana Bafana captain Aaron Mokoena. Mokoena also captained English Premier League clubs Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth. The Games, founded by Patrick Ntenjwa in 1996, has grown. Previous tournament winners only won prize money of R5000 but this year the eventual champions will get a whopping R120 000. Ntenjwa said the tournament had a rich history in South African football and that it had been a breeding ground for a number of talented footballers. Former players were at the launch, including former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana striker Jerry Sikhosana, and former Kaizer Chiefs and Pirates maestro Stanton Fredericks. The games will commence on December 21 and end on January 6 2018 with all 40 teams expected to play.
