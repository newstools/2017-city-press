Zolani Tete knocked out Siboniso Gonya in just 11 seconds in the quickest-ever world title fight in the history of boxing. The 29-year-old landed a brutal right hook just six seconds into the bout to retain his World Boxing Organization (WBO) bantamweight at Belfast's SSE Arena. And the referee officially waved away the contest just five seconds later as the South African lay sprawled on his back. Tete's win broke a previous one set by former WBO super-bantamweight champion Daniel Jimenez who knocked out Harald Geier in 17 seconds. Tete immediately set his sights on a huge unification fight against World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation champ Ryan Burnett in 2018. The referee waved away the fight after the Gonya was knocked out with a brutal right hook. Medics rushed to aide of Gonya, but thankfully there was no serious damage. Speaking in his post-match interview, Tete said: "I've been training so hard for this fight. READ:Â Tete refuses to lose focus after burglary "I knew Gonya wasn't going to last.
