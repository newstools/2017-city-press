Yet you accuse us of state capture.&rdquo;Zuma said, although Gordhan didn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge it, he and the Gupta family had &ldquo;consistently welcomed a Judicial Commission of Inquiry into all state capture&rdquo;.He said Gordhan&rsquo;s &ldquo;friends&rdquo; in the banking industry has closed all of his bank accounts, &ldquo;likely with your support&rdquo;. &ldquo;Anybody can see that you are in bed with them, rather than on the side of hard-working South African citizens,&rdquo; Zuma charged.He said he was selling his shares to be able to focus his time on clearing his name. &ldquo;At this point I would advise you to refrain from public statements that could affect the current sales and my reputation. I reserve my rights to pursue legal action for the harm you are causing,&rdquo; he wrote.He said that he and the Gupta family, pledged 15 months ago to &ldquo;exit our South African investments to make sure the jobs of our fellow South Africans are protected.
