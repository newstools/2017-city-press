Johannesburg - South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan and PSL chair ­Irvin Khoza have achieved a lot ­together – they successfully bid for the right to host the 2010 soccer World Cup. Khoza chaired the bid committee and, later, the local organising committee for the event. Jordaan served as the chief executive for both structures. However, there have regularly been ­reports of tension between the two. This became more evident when they were both nominated for the ­position of Safa president in 2009. It was such a hard-fought battle that they eventually withdrew after a day of haggling at the Safa annual ­general meeting, with Kirsten ­Nematandani emerging as the ­compromise candidate. When national teams have international engagements and the club­versus-county ­issue rears its ugly head fingers are automatically pointed at the squabbles between the ­ultrapowerful personalities.
