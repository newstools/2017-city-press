The multi-award winning gospel singer Dr Tumi wants to emulate, if not challenge, rapper Cassper Nyovest who filled the Dome with fans and admirers last year. Tumisang Makweya, aka Dr Tumi, is a medical doctor turned gospel singer. He told City Press that plans were under way for yet another milestone – filling up the Coca-Cola Dome – on August 20. “I believe I’m going to do it,” he said. The gospel singer and writer has become a household name with his two albums Love and Grace and Heart of a King. He said music lovers around the country had received the songs well, and he scooped trophies at various awards ceremonies since his music career started in 2013. He has bagged a total of 13 awards in total in recent months including six Crown Awards, one MetroFm Music Award and two South African Music Awards. “I will be recording a live DVD with some of my well-known songs and some of my new songs.” Dr Tumi recently signed an international deal with Universal Music that will see him doing international tours and concert. He described the pending adventure as a blessing and he hoped to use “the fill up the dome with Dr Tumi” as a springboard for his international tour. However, he is keeping the details close to his heart. “I have invited all the worshippers to come and witness the power of God in action,” he said, adding that he planned to make the event memorable for everyone who will be attending. “I am going to fill it to its capacity.” The venue holds about 20 000 people. “The Lord has been great to me since I started my music career and many people love my work,” he said. Dr Tumi also promised a massive line-up of gospel stars to join him on stage during his performance at the Dome. He would not be drawn into revealing the names of his guests, saying it was meant to be a wonderful surprise for the audience.
