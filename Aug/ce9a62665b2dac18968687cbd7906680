Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter wants to have a heart-to-heart talk with striker Tokelo Rantie when he arrives to join the camp this evening. Bafana stepped up their preparations on Wednesday for their crucial 2018 World Cup qualifier without Rantie and this did not go down well with Baxter. The Turkey-based striker was the only missing player at camp during Wednesday’s training session after he allegedly missed his flight in Turkey. He was due to arrive in Cape Verde on Wednesday evening, meaning he would only have one training session with the team ahead of the crucial qualifier against the hosts on Friday evening. Kickoff is at 8.30pm (SA time). All the other overseas-based players – Kermit Erasmus, Andile Jali, Kamohelo Mokotjo, Bongani Zungu and Keagan Dolly – were all at camp by the time Bafana arrived in Praia on Tuesday evening after connecting directly to the Atlantic Ocean Island. Baxter was not happy with Rantie’s tardiness but said he would give him a chance to explain himself. He said he would sit down with the striker to get his side of the story on his late arrival and take it from there. Rantie was Bafana’s hero against Nigeria in Uyo in June when he scored an opener against the Super Eagles and he is a shoo-in to start the game, if he shows up.
