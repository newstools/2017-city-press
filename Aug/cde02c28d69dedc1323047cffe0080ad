With the average house price for a first-time buyer reaching nearly the R1 million mark, few people can afford to buy a home on their own. A R900 000 home loan will require a monthly repayment of R8 800 – this is before you have even started paying for rates, electricity and water. Realistically, to qualify for the home loan, one would need to have around R10 000 of disposable income after meeting other debt obligations. One option is to apply for a joint home loan. Simphiwe Madikizela, head of special projects at FNB Housing Finance, says a joint application can help increase your chances as both parties’ incomes and expenses are taken into account. However, you need to understand the legal ramifications: PROS: CONS: During the application process, both parties need to sign all the necessary documents such as the offer to purchase, home loan quote and legal documents, and so on. Most importantly, the monthly debit order has to come from one account. As a result, this will have to be agreed beforehand to ensure that there are always funds available to avoid defaulting on the monthly bond repayments. “Buying a property is a big commitment and the decision to buy with someone else should not be taken lightly. The parties need to work out all the eventualities before taking ownership as shortcomings could potentially set you back financially,” says Madikizela.
