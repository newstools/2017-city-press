City Press is in New York this week, covering WWE events like the NXT Takeover Brooklyn II, Smackdown and Raw. With the pure spectacle and production of WWE bigger and better than ever before, we thought we’d give you our picks of what we think is the six best wrestler entrances. 6. Finn Balor Demon King Finn Balor is here to scare the hell out of his opponents, and you. Covered in his signature body paint, he creeps across the stage and into the ring, eek!  5. Asuka The amazingly unhinged NXT champion ensures a spectacle every time she steps into the ring. The coat, the mask, the music – it all just adds to Asuka’s appeal.  4. Bray Wyatt Fans love Bray’s entrance, always getting out their phones to ad to the eerie atmosphere. Wyatt is a creepy lantern-bearer and we just can’t get enough.  3. The New Day You can’t help but smile when The New Day enter the ring. Trombones, colourful spandex and those light-up unicorn horns, you know it’s a party when The New Day enter the ring.  2. The Undertaker Old school legend The Undertaker has many was of entering the ring, including rising out of a coffin. But nothing tops when the gong starts chiming, the lights go out, and the undertaker pops up out of nowhere in the middle of the ring.  1. Bobby Roode But even the Undertaker can’t compete with Bobby Roode’s flashy, ostentatious, hilarious entrances. It’s just ... glorious!  * WWE will air on Supersport 4, 7, 9 and 10 from August 28 across 50 sub-Saharan African countries.
