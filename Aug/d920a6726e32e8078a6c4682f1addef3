This past weekend saw Joburg roar with excitement as the Castle Lite NBA Africa Games kicked off but with a dramatic end, Team Africa were defeated by Team World 108-97 at the The Dome on Saturday. Whether you were then celebrating the win or feeling gloom because of Team Africaâ€™s defeat, the stars moved to the Extra Cold Blue Carpet to party up a storm with international basketball players. Some spotted at the party were Thierry Henry, Pearl Thusi, Denise Zimba, Dash as well as Ayanda Thabethe. And to entertain everyone post living their best court-side life were local artists such as Speedsta, Vigi, Snypes, DJ PH with an added live performance by rapper Riky Rick.
