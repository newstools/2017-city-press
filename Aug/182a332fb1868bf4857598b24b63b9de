@TimspiritMolobi in Praia With the transfer window period closing at midnight today, Cape Town City captain Lebogang Manyama could be on the move – but not in South Africa. Manyama was seeing pacing up and down at the Pestana Hotel in Cape Verde with a contract in hand – ready to sign and send it back. City Press can reveal that he got an offer from Turkey side Konyaspor and was considering the move. But he was cagey about it and did not want to reveal anything until the deal was concluded. He said he would wait until everything had been signed and sealed before he would celebrate. “Until all has been done, including the medicals, I can’t say anything,” said Manyama. “For now my focus is on Bafana and we have an important game tomorrow which requires all my attention. My people are working on it and we’ll know before close of business today.” He was initially linked with a move to big-spending Mamelodi Sundowns but it looks like the Turkish side have beaten the Brazilians to his signature. Manyama was dropped by coach Benni McCarthy for City’s MTN8 semifinal clash against Bidvest Wits last weekend as his mind was not there because of his pending move, according to the coach.
