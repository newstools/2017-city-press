The City of Cape Town is set to take drastic measures as dam levels drop to 26.2% of usable water.On average, this leaves the city with about 135 days&rsquo; worth of drinking water.Strict water restrictions have been imposed on Cape Town residents to conserve water and reduce water shortages.&ldquo;The primary thing is to get people to reduce consumption. We are phoning high water users, visiting businesses and alerting people through radio, the newspapers and social media to give them warnings and spread the message,&rdquo; said City of Cape Town spokesperson Priya Reddy.The Voelvlei dam down 2.2% to 39.8%. The Berg River Dam down 2% to 45.8%.&ldquo;On a wide scale we will reduce water pressure and implement other water planning measures,&rdquo; Reddy said. She added that the average stipulated water use was 700ml a day but people used 800ml.She said this was the City&rsquo;s main cause for concern because &ldquo;the last 10% of dam water can&rsquo;t be used because it&rsquo;s full of salt&rdquo;.The most critical dams were the Theewaterskloof, Steenbras, Vo&euml;lvlei and Berg River dams.You will only understand the extent of the water crisis in the Western Cape when you see what the Theewaterskloof Dam looks like...#WCWater pic.twitter.com/I7mZzIcXUePLEASE RT: A very scary view of an extremely dried up Theewaterskloof Dam.

That's a massive 10,02 percentage point rise in 24 hours alone!!The Gauteng weather service predicted that the Vaal might still cross over the 85% boundary on Thursday. pic.twitter.com/QJT8qzhRfmThe Grootdraai Dam, recorded to be 102.51% full, had been opened and its water would be flowing into the Vaal Dam on Thursday morning, Gauteng Weather said. ?? FUN FACT: VAAL DAM received the volume of almost one Olympic-sized swimming pool EVERY SECOND over the past 24 hours!!!Other dams&rsquo; water levels also increased over the rainy two weeks in South Africa. The Gariep Dam, South Africa&rsquo;s biggest dam, was currently more than 72% full as the gushing Orange River continued to feed it.
