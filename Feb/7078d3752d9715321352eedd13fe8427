The EFF has been accusing Ngomana of having multiple identity documents and passports for a while. The party opened a case with the police in 2014, but nothing came of it.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be in the midst of an illegal immigrant. Is there no Parliament in Mozambique?&rdquo; Sedibe said.Legislature speaker Thandi Shongwe said it was pointless for the EFF to raise the matter of Ngomana&rsquo;s citizenship in the legislature.&ldquo;This matter is not part of these proceedings. You&rsquo;ve been raising it for two years. You must approach the relevant authorities,&rdquo; Shongwe said.Skhosana said that police threatened Sedibe with arrest as he arrived at the legislature. He refused to leave when ordered to do so.Shongwe called the security personnel to remove the EFF members but a scuffle ensued and EFF members threw water bottles at ANC politicians.Mabuza delivered his speech after the EFF had left.The legislature is still in session.
