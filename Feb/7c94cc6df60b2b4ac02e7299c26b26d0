Yesterday&rsquo;s state of the nation address was once again filled with heightened emotion and passion, mainly from the opposition. Before President Jacob Zuma even rose to address the joint sitting of Parliament, the Economic Freedom Fighters were on their feet calling for a point of order. Zuma eventually managed to make it to the podium but barely got through the greeting when a plethora of voices forced the speakers to make him take his seat. And then chaos ensued, again. But even before the honourable members of Parliament appeared in the Mother City, 441 South African National Defence Force members patrolled the streets.
