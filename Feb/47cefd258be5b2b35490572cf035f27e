The National Youth Development Agency board is one step closer to assuming office after Parliament voted in its favour on Thursday.After numerous delays, seven candidates were nominated to serve on the NYDA board for three years. They are Ndumiso Thokozani Mokako, Itiseng Kenneth Morolong, Yershen Pillay, Sifiso John Mtsweni, Zandile Majozi, Bavelile Gloria Hlongwa, and Khomotjo Joy Maimela. On Thursday, 174 MPs voted in favour of the appointments, 92 against, and 10 abstained.&nbsp;The names would be sent to President Jacob Zuma for approval.Debating the merits of the board before the vote, EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu said that, at the moment, the NYDA did not provide any hope for the youth.&nbsp; In the hunt for the board, capable chartered accountants, advocates and lawyers had been overlooked as they were not associated with ANC Youth League structures, he said.&nbsp; "Young, capable people who have gained practical governance experience, who would have given life to NYDA, were overlooked in face of partisanship." DA MP Yusuf Cassim said the NYDA was "an employment agency for the African National Congress Youth League elite and its alliance partners". ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu welcomed the National Assembly&rsquo;s approval of the board&rsquo;s appointment. "We are confident that these selected candidates are fit, proper and capable to discharge their responsibilities. We have no doubt that they will hit the ground running when they start their term as board members in serving the youth of South Africa."
