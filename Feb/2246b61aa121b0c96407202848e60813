Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu has stepped down with immediate effect following findings into her role in the deaths of 94 mentally ill patients. Mahlangu&rsquo;s resignation was received by Gauteng Premier David Makhura on Friday, four days before the report into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the patients was released in Pretoria.Makhura said he has accepted Mahlangu&rsquo;s resignation and commended her for stepping down.&ldquo;She fully understood that if anything goes wrong in your area of responsibility you have to take direct accountability,&rdquo; he said.In an indication that the matter is now being played out amongst the ANC&rsquo;s competing factions, the Gauteng ANC Youth League has entered the fray. In a strongly worded statement the league has called for &ldquo;the immediate resignation of the premier, whose administration has presided over the cruel and untimely deaths of innocent patients&rdquo;. The league said that it would give Makhura 14 working days to resign after which they will occupy his office until he accedes to their demands.&nbsp;Tomorrow the provincial branch of the youth league plans to lay criminal charges of murder against the &ldquo;disgraceful former MEC&rdquo;, and have called upon the ANC to suspend Mahlangu&rsquo;s ANC membership and institute disciplinary proceedings against her.&ldquo;The ANC Youth League will over the next few weeks be visiting families of the deceased to offer our condolences and assist families to institute lawsuits against the provincial government,&rdquo; said Mbali Hlophe, the ANCYL Gauteng spokesperson.Makhura also said he regretted that so many people had to die while under the care of the provincial department of health.He also assured the families who lost their loved ones that serious action would be taken against all officials implicated in the report.Deputy Health Minister Gwen Ramokgopa will take over Mahlangu&rsquo;s position.At least 94 mentally ill patients who were transferred from Life Esidimeni Health Care Centre to various hospitals and 27 NGOs between April and June last year died during the move. Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba revealed in Pretoria today that their deaths were negligent with 80% of the deaths having occurred in five NGOs.Makgoba had asked Makhura to consider the suitability of Mahlangu to hold office. Makgoba said Mahlangu was not only negligent in transferring mentally ill patients to unlicensed NGOs but he was not truthful about the number of patients who died in these facilities. On September 13 last year, Mahlangu announced during her reply in the legislature that 37 patients had died. However, Makgoba refuted this saying by this time 77 patients had already died.He questioned why the MEC had not known that the number of people who had died had already doubled.Makgoba went on to say: &ldquo;On November 29, I interviewed the MEC and asked her how many patients had died since the patients were transferred from Life Esidimeni Health Care Centre and she said 40.&rdquo;&ldquo;I then asked the head of department the same question and he said 37 patients. I asked the director of the department and the director said 48.&rdquo;&ldquo;In this situation, you have three most senior people in the department not knowing a simple number in a service that they provide. This to me is pure negligence of their duties,&rdquo; Makgoba said.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said he was distressed and angry at how this whole situation was handled.&ldquo;Something like this should have been avoided,&rdquo; he said.
