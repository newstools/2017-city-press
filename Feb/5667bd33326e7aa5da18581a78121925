Youth League president Collen Maine calling Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan an &ldquo;impimpi&rdquo; (a spy) hasn&rsquo;t gone down well in political circles.The ANC has distanced itself from him, and the Congress of the People has called on Maine to be fired and the State Security Agency to investigate.The ANC&rsquo;s spokesperson Zizi Kodwa called the statement &ldquo;reckless and regrettable&rdquo;. &ldquo;To attack a minister appointed by President Jacob Zuma is out of line,&rdquo; Kodwa told News24 today.According to a weekend report by IOL, Maine accused Gordhan of being an &ldquo;impimpi&rdquo; for monopoly capital. He told delegates to the provincial elective conference in Durban how &ldquo;izimpimpi&rdquo; were dealt with during the struggle for freedom &ndash; they would have been necklaced.After his spy allegation, Maine reportedly added that &ldquo;something must be done&rdquo; to Gordhan.&ldquo;This is a very serious allegation against a senior Cabinet minister, the minister of finance in this country,&rdquo; said Congress of the People spokesperson Dennis Bloem.He called it &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo; that Maine made these allegations in the presence of President Jacob Zuma, who &ldquo;said nothing about it&rdquo; and that Maine was not reprimanded for going too far labelling his minister a spy.&ldquo;The ANC is seriously taking the people of this country for fools. Instead of firing this loose cannon, they once again came out with a statement, saying Maine&rsquo;s utterance of labelling Gordhan a spy is irresponsible and reckless.&rdquo;Bloem said it had become a habit in the ANC to label anyone the party differed with a spy, referring to former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, who was labelled a CIA spy.&ldquo;The state security minister promised the country that he would make the report public regarding his investigations. The country still awaits his report to be made public.&rdquo;He added that &ldquo;this is part of the Zuma faction and they want to get rid of Gordhan so that they can lay their hands on Treasury&rdquo;.Cope called on the ANC to fire Maine before he &ldquo;caused more damage to the economy and the country&rdquo;.Kodwa said on Monday that no structure of the ANC, including the youth league, should use that term for Gordhan.&ldquo;It is completely out of order and irresponsible. We think there is everything wrong with that statement politically. The ANC at some point will talk to him and get clarity. We are looking forward to meeting with him and getting clarity on this statement.&rdquo;The youth league said it would comment on the matter at a later stage. &ndash; Additional reporting by Kaveel Singh, News24
