President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s eldest son, Edward Zuma, says those who don&rsquo;t like the idea of his dad delivering the state of the nation address (Sona) should find a way to get used to it, as he will be doing so for another two years.&ldquo;In terms of the Constitution of this country, he will cease power in 2019. So, they will have to listen to him next year when he presents [Sona] as well as in 2019, so they must just face that,&rdquo; an annoyed Zuma told City Press by phone.Thursday evening saw violent scenes both inside and outside of Parliament when parliamentary protection services forcibly removed the Economic Freedom Fighters from the National Assembly. Other opposition parties walked out shortly after the chaos.Zuma said the &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; of Sona was intended to embarrass his father.&ldquo;The intention is to embarrass the president, but whatever tricks they try, they will not manage. &ldquo;The man is the president of the republic &ndash; they must just face it. If they won&rsquo;t accept that, they must hit the floor and the ceiling and go to hell,&rdquo; he said.Zuma also weighed on the succession debate in the ANC that the party has been unable to quell. He said that the president would not be seeking a third time as the Constitution of the ANC did not allow it. The ANC Women&rsquo;s League was the first structure in the ANC to pronounce on who should succeed the president, throwing their weight behind former AU Commission chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.The younger Zuma would not be baited into making any pronouncement of his own.&ldquo;Yes, we are ready for a woman president. I can&rsquo;t comment on names, but we are ready. Mam&rsquo; Baleka [Mbete, speaker] can be, mam&rsquo; Nomvula [Mokonyane, minister of water and sanitation] can be, mam&rsquo; Thandi [Modise, chairperson of the national council of provinces]...&ldquo;It will be the decision of ANC branch delegates as to whether or not the next president of the ANC is a woman.&rdquo;
