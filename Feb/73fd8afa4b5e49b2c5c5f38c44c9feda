Serious concerns were expressed in Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts on Tuesday morning about the chief executive of the Social Security Agency allegedly being suspended at a time of a impending crisis over social grants payouts.Social development director-general Zane Dangor informed members of Parliament in Scopa that Sassa&rsquo;s chief executive, Thokozani Magwaza, was &ldquo;booked off ill&rdquo;. Dangor cited hypertension as the illness.The chief executive of the National Development Agency Thamo Mzobe has been appointed as acting Sassa chief executive, effective from the same morning of the Scopa meeting.But according to media reports, Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini suspended Magwaza, who had been in the post since November last year.Dlamini too, who was expected to lead a press conference at Parliament late on Tuesday, was absent.Inkatha Freedom Party member of Parliament Mkhulelo Hlengwa expressed concern over whether the new chief executive would be able to answer any questions.&ldquo;The game of musical chairs on the eve of a crisis is very concerning ... it is the beneficiaries of social grants who will suffer from this.&rdquo;Hlengwa insisted on &ldquo;practical clarity&rdquo; on how the social grants crisis will be addressed.Democratic Alliance member of Parliament Tim Brauteseth accused Dangor of being &ldquo;economical with the truth&rdquo; and referred to media reports that claimed that the chief executive had been suspended.Committee chairperson Themba Godi warned that the concern over Sassa grants was more than just an administrative issue, but also a political issue.&ldquo;If you have a semblance of respect for our people, it is now your chance to demonstrate it,&rdquo; he told the delegation.Magwaza was reportedly suspended because he approached the Post Office over the payment of grants. This was against Dlamini&rsquo;s wishes. The current contract expires on March 31 without any clear plan on how Sassa will handle the payout of social grants.It is expected that Sassa will meet with Cash Paymaster Services on Wednesday to negotiate a new contract.The meeting is still under way.
