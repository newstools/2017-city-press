The majority died from dehydration, starvation, pneumonia and uncontrolled fits. In her resignation statement Mahlangu said &ldquo;the Health Ombud has not found any culpability on my part for the unfortunate loss of lives by the patients; accepting that the de-institutionalization of mental health patients is a sound and internationally recognised programme." Expressing her regret, she further stated, "I want to reiterate my regret at the loss of lives associated with the transfer of patients from Life Esidimeni to the various NGOs and extend my condolences to the bereaved families". Premier of Gauteng David Makhura announced that Mahlangu will be replaced by Deputy Health Minister Gwen Ramokgopa who is a medical doctor and former mayor of the City of Tshwane.
