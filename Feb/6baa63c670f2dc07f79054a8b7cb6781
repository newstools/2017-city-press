Missed the debate on Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s state of the nation address? It was like a school yard as members of Parliament hurled insults at each other across the house, in the guise of a debate on Zuma&rsquo;s speech.Here are some of the punchlines that kept South Africa giggling over the past two days:1. South Africans know President Jacob Zuma will never deliver on his state of the nation address promises. The unemployed must have been disappointed by &ldquo;more rhetoric, more empty promises and another year of despair&rdquo; from Zuma.&ndash; Democratic Alliance chief whip John Steenhuisen 2. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, when [Zuma] droned on in that monotone, he put his own benches to sleep, and he made this nation weep.&rdquo;&ndash; DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen3. &ldquo;Mr Zuma is the modern-day prophet Hananiah in the book of Jeremiah ... Every year he comes to this podium with a new speech of false promises, which he fails to fulfil.&rdquo; &ndash; DA MP Solly Malatsi.4. &ldquo;President Zuma: what have you got against white people in South Africa? You are using white people as a scapegoat to hide your inability as a government. If you want economic growth, put a moratorium on all black economic empowerment policies and affirmative action.&rdquo; &ndash; FF Plus leader Pieter Groenewald.5. &ldquo;All that [DA MP Mike] Waters did was whine and whine and whine.&rdquo;&ndash; Deputy Minister in the Presidency Kgwaridi Buti Manamela6. &ldquo;Until when are going to allow the Economic Freedom Fighters to use their hard hats as weapons?&rdquo;&ndash; ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu 7. Ejected members from the state of the nation address &ldquo;suffer from pop star political syndrome&rdquo;.&ndash; ANC MP Sahlulele Luzipo Other insults:8. DA MP Solly Malatsi was called a &ldquo;sellout&rdquo; by an ANC MP. He had sparked the ire of the ANC caucus when he referred to a media report that alleged that Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti had helped friends secure the title deed to the Limpopo farm Bekendvlei for R97m.DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen rose on a point of order, and wanted the responsible ANC MP reprimanded, because the word had previously been declared unparliamentary.Deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said he had not heard &ldquo;sellout&rdquo; and the MP responsible was not coming forward.He however ordered Malatsi to withdraw his comments about Nkwinti, as he had heard those. He withdrew.9. Later in the debate, another ANC MP called DA deputy chief whip Mike Waters a &ldquo;clown&rdquo;. Tsenoli reprimanded him and ordered him to withdraw.He repeated that Waters was a clown, but withdrew.10. ANC MPs continued their tradition of heckling Cope MP Deidre Carter by making cat noises as she spoke. They were not reprimanded for it.
