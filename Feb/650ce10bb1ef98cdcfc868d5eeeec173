Political parties will debate President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s State of the Nation address on Tuesday and Wednesday.The president&rsquo;s Sona was again marred by fisticuffs, swearing, heckling, and walkouts.The stringent security measures which were carried out in and around Parliament for the Sona were, however, dismissed by the country&rsquo;s security agencies as &ldquo;a perception&rdquo;.Police were highly visible, positioned as they were in Cape Town&rsquo;s central business district in groups of about 10 every few metres, milling around the area and at entry points to it. More manpower was deployed inside the parliamentary precinct, including plain-clothed officers and members of the intelligence community.But those in charge of the security plan claim the numbers have been exaggerated and nothing was extraordinary about this year&rsquo;s Sona security plan.The DA has approached the courts, seeking a declaration that Thursday&rsquo;s deployment of SA National Defence Force members to the parliamentary precinct for non-ceremonial purposes was unconstitutional and unlawful. The party added that it was taking legal action to ensure that the gradual securitisation and militarisation of Parliament was halted once and for all. &ldquo;The presence of the national defence force, in a way that far exceeded a mere ceremonial role, can never be tolerated again,&rdquo; said DA leader Mmusi Maimane. He said the presence of armed military police with live ammunition on the precinct of Parliament was untenable in a constitutional democracy. &ldquo;Our court action is [being taken] to ensure that the integrity of Parliament is restored and that we can make the work of Parliament about the people of South Africa once more. &ldquo;It ought to be an institution in which we can fight for the poor and the excluded, an institution which vigorously holds power to account,&rdquo; he added. National defence force spokesperson Siphiwe Dlamini declined to comment on whether there were military personnel on the precinct besides those who were there for ceremonial purposes. He referred the questions to Parliament, saying it was dealing with the matter.EFF MPs will miss the Sona debate as they were automatically suspended for five working days following their violent ejection from the National Assembly.DA MPs, who walked out before Zuma delivered his speech, said on Sunday that they would attend the debate.The one-and-a-half-hour-long speech was &ldquo;weak, uninspiring and racially divisive, devoid of any new ideas on how to free our young people from the shackles of joblessness and hopelessness,&rdquo; the party said.Cope would be participating as well, leader Mosiuoa Lekota said on Monday, even though the party said Zuma&rsquo;s speech carried little weight and was just smoke and mirrors.Zuma focused on economic transformation, university fees, land, and corruption.He said his &ldquo;caring&rdquo; government would look into the prospect of raising the National Student Financial Aid Scheme threshold to above R122 000, in phases. Students from families earning below R600 000 a year would continue to have their tuition fee increases covered.He called for arable land to be returned to blacks. It would be &ldquo;difficult, if not impossible&rdquo;, to achieve true reconciliation until the land question was resolved, he said.Read: How radical will Zuma really be?Zuma would reply to the debate on Thursday.
