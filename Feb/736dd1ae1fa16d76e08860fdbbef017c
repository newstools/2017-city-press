New cars, a new parking zone for supporters – Kaizer Chiefs reckon their new partnership with vehicle manufacturer Toyota is a match made in heaven. “We couldn’t have chosen a better car manufacturer than Toyota to partner with,” chief executive Kaizer Motaung said during a press conference at Naturena this afternoon. Chiefs announced the new sponsorship deal with Toyota South Africa on Wednesday afternoon at Naturena. Speculation was rife earlier this week that the team was close to reaching an agreement that was finally announced today on Amakhosi’s Twitter account. The Japanese-car based manufacture’s deal is three years long and will be the official motor vehicle supplier to Amakhosi. The deal will see the corporation supply the club with 20 vehicles to meet all its transportation requirements. The fleet ranges from hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs and bakkies to panel vans and minibuses. President and chief executive of Toyota SA, Andrew Kirby, said “the supporters will benefit from the new deal as Kaizer Chiefs and Toyota have allocated 250 free and secure parking for Toyota vehicle drivers attending home matches at the FNB stadium. Kirby said that this area will be called “Toyota Zone” and the supporters will be allocated parking on first come, first served basis. This seems to be another way of attracting football lovers at the stadiums – a challenge all South African teams are facing, “Toyota is one of the biggest is one of the biggest motor vehicle manufacturers in the world and the brand is synonymous with reliability across the globe,” Motaung said.
