Fed up with their 8km walk to school, through crime-ridden veld, hundreds of pupils embarked on a protest in the North West, demanding scholar transport.This was the second day of protests targeted at provincial authorities by pupils at Gaetsho and JM High schools.Yesterday, about 1000 pupils from Blydeville commenced their protests in Lichtenburg. But today their action intensified as they burnt tyres and blocked the town&rsquo;s main road.They resorted to protests because they were tired of walking from Blydeville to Boikhutso, where they attend classes.According to Alfanzo Noge, a concerned parent, the pupils resorted to burning tyres and barricading the road in Lichtenburg because officials were not responsive to demands for scholar transport.Noge said traffic was disrupted and police had to intervene. &ldquo;Our children walk about 8km to these schools and have to pass through sugar cane fields and grassy areas where crime is rife. They get robbed.&rdquo;He said Ditsobotla Local Municipality mayor Lesego Holele addressed disgruntled pupils at a local stadium. North West provincial education spokesperson Freddy Sepeng said the department was working closely with the provincial transport department to resolve the matter. &ldquo;We are working on finding a solution,&rdquo; Sepeng said.Attempts were made to get a comment from Ditsobotla Local Municipality, but were unsuccessful.Last week, residents of Itsoseng in Lichtenburg embarked on protests, which turned violent, over service delivery issues.
