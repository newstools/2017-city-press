Johannesburg DA mayor Herman Mashaba&rsquo;s plan to accelerate service delivery in Johannesburg now includes a proposal to reintegrate municipal-owned entities back into the city.The proposal for the big move was approved by the Johannesburg city council on Thursday.The likes of City Power, Joburg Water and embattled Pikitup are among the entities that the mayor would like to see brought back to the city.&ldquo;How can a city be responsible and accountable to its residents for fast-tracking service delivery when it doesn&rsquo;t have complete control over the entities that implement delivery?&rdquo; Mashaba is said to have asked the council.&ldquo;I am not aware of these boards featuring on ballot papers. Boards have all the powers of directing service delivery through these entities with zero accountability to the residents.&rdquo;Mashaba said that he was adamant that no job losses would be incurred during the process, except those of nonexecutive directors on boards that cost a total of R18 million in the current financial year.Soon after winning his mayorship, Mashaba fingered Pikitup as a source of trouble, saying that he would look to have it broken up into seven pieces and given to smaller business.His spokesperson, Tony Taverna-Turisan, told City Press yesterday that that plan now falls away in light of this new proposal.The next step is an investigation into the feasibility of such a move.&ldquo;It is going to be an 18-month process, but that is going to require a feasibility study to assess the impact of the integration. "We have to ensure that there are minimal interruptions to service delivery and that we are doing everything in the best interests of residents,&rdquo; Taverna-Turisan said.Mashaba is reported to have told the council that cities such as eThekweni and Cape Town had already proved that the reintegration of such entities was the best way to speed up service delivery.&ldquo;There is no question that service delivery has been too slow in our city, and residents made this clear when they voted for change on the August 3 2016,&rdquo; Mashaba said.TALK TO USDo you agree with Mashaba&rsquo;s reintegration plan?SMS us on 35697 using the keyword MASHABA and tell us what you think.
