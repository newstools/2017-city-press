The last award of Saturday night&rsquo;s Metro FM awards was the coveted Song of the Year, which went to Nasty C for his hit Hell Naw.Nasty C is signed to Mabala Noise, the record label owned by ANC Youth League national treasurer Reggie Nkabinde.Nasty C, real name David Ngcobo, called Nkabinde on stage at the Durban&rsquo;s Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre to accept the award with him. But Nkabinde was booed by the crowd when he said that South Africans should be ashamed of themselves for not producing an artist that is successful around the world.After the Song of the Year Award was presented, Nasty C&rsquo;s fellow Mabala Noise stablemate, Riky Rick tweeted after the awards ceremony: "If niggaz can pay for these fucking awards then my nigga I don&rsquo;t want them..." - RIKY RICK 2016It was not immediately clear whether or not he was being ironic because Riky Rick won this year&rsquo;s Best Hit Single award for Sidlukotini.The closing performance of the night was delivered by Babes Wodumo whom Twitter felt was robbed of the Song of the Year Award for her hit single Wololo.
