The presidency and the department of sport and recreation have expressed their condolences at the passing of legendary boxing mentor and trainer, Nick Durandt. Known for his ability to produce champion boxers, Durandt produced a number of winners on the South African and international scene, with famous charges such as Thulani “Sugarboy” Malinga, Philip “The Time Bomb” Ndou, Cassius Baloyi, Silence Mabuza and Hawk Makepula. President Jacob Zuma in a statement on Saturday said that “South Africa has lost one of its best trainers in the history of boxing, who was not only a trainer, promoter and manager but also a father figure to his stellar trainees. Durandt was renowned for taking young boys out of the streets and making champions out of them.” Sport and Recreation Minister Thembelani Nxesi echoed Zuma’s sentiment yesterday, saying: “I wish to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt and deep condolences to his family, friends and all those who were touched by the late Nick Durandt’s magnanimous talent.” Durandt died in a motorcycle accident between Clarens and Bethlehem in the Free State yesterday. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died from internal bleeding. “Though words cannot be enough to express our condolences to the Durant family, we hope they find comfort in the messages of support given to them by the sports fraternity and the boxing family at large. As part of our tribute to Nick Durant, the ministry of sport and recreation strives to continue to support boxing and further ensure that it continues to grow as a well-respected sport. Our prayers and thoughts are with the Durant family during this time,” the minister concluded.
