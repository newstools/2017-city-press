I am no coward, said Jackson Mthembu, chief whip of the ANC, in Parliament on Friday, in response to criticism of the ANC caucus&rsquo; decision to vote against the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.&nbsp; The motion will be debated on April 18.&nbsp; Mthembu, who was among the first ANC leaders to criticise the dismissal of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister, has now ostensibly changed his tune &shy;- even though he denies doing so.&nbsp; Defending his position against the motion on Twitter, Mthembu referred to the &ldquo;revolutionary discipline&rdquo; of ANC MPs, to which somebody responded: &ldquo;There's nothing revolutionary about protecting a thief.&rdquo;We might hold strong views on whatever matter , @ParliamentofRSA we are @MYANC MPs and not apologetic for that . Revolutionary discipline.Mthembu however made it clear that he still stands by his position on Gordhan as well as the so-called intelligence report which apparently contributed to Gordhan&rsquo;s dismissal.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I will and have raised my position within the ANC&rsquo;s national executive committee,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The point is, the ANC has made a decision. It now has to be implemented. Even if you don&rsquo;t agree with an issue, when a decision is made you defend it as if it&rsquo;s your own. That&rsquo;s a decision you would die by. You implement it. That is leadership. It&rsquo;s not cowardice. You stand by your principles.&rdquo; Mthembu&rsquo;s comments follow contrary remarks made by Kgalema Motlanthe in an interview with Daily Maverick. Motlanthe said that ANC-MPs would not be violating the ANC&rsquo;s constitution if they voted in favour of the motion. Motlanthe said there was no ANC policy that governed such a vote.&nbsp; Motlanthe is of the opinion that the parliamentary caucus are public representatives that can&rsquo;t be treated like an ANC branch.&nbsp; But Mthembu disagrees. He didn&rsquo;t want to respond directly to Motlanthe&rsquo;s comments &ldquo;out of respect for the man&rdquo;. &nbsp; &ldquo;The ANC can&rsquo;t help the opposition get rid of an ANC member.&nbsp; &ldquo;What organisation with any self-respect would do that.&rdquo; He also warned about the precedent that would be created if ANC members voted against their own people.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our integrity is in intact. We follow the directive of our party. What are we saying to ANC members in municipalities and in other places when we vote with the opposition? It could turn the whole country upside down. We won&rsquo;t have an ANC as the centre of authority will cease to exist.&rdquo; Mthembu however said that what did irritate him was ANC leaders that seemingly don&rsquo;t have faith in their own MPs. He referred to ANC-MPs who have now been reminded that they can be fired if they support the motion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe in my MPs and their credibility. I believe in their political uprightness. We have defeated four such motions already,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;
