Today marked the 24th anniversary of the death of struggle icon and SACP leader Chris Hani. Hani was murdered on April 10 1993 outside his home in Boksburg. President Jacob Zuma led the annual wreath laying ceremony at Thomas Nkobi Memorial Park in Boksburg. Additionally, Zuma unveiled a plaque on the declaration of Hani&rsquo;s grave and the Chris Hani Memorial and Walk of Remembrance as a National Heritage Site. In his address, Zuma called Hani a &ldquo;distinguished freedom fighter&rdquo; and said that &ldquo;he lived for his people&rdquo;. &ldquo;In their actions, the killers of Chris Hani sought to sow division among the people of South Africa so that they could protect minority interests,&rdquo; he said. Zuma called on South Africans to fight racism and work toward a non-racial society. He said Hani believed in a non-racial society.

Many placards and posters displayed beliefs that we thought had been buried in 1994, with some posters depicting black people as baboons. It is clear that some of our white compatriots regard black people as being lesser human beings or sub-human.&rdquo;He said the &ldquo;racist onslaught has become more direct and is no longer hidden&rdquo; as it was during the earlier years of democracy.&ldquo;Racists no longer fear being caught or exposed,&rdquo; he said.Hani&rsquo;s widow, Limpho, also attended the ceremony and addressed the crowd before Zuma. In her speech she took a moment to say that she is a member of the ANC, and did not support a faction of the party.

He knew how to identify the enemy. He knew how to properly analyse that enemy and he knew when to shoot at the enemy. Do we still have the same discipline of bravery and strategic thinking in our ranks?&rdquo; In the statement, Dlamini also reiterated calls from Cosatu and the SACP for Zuma to step down. &ldquo;Perhaps coming here today to this gravesite to be closer to the spirit of comrade Chris &ndash; the brave revolutionary of our struggle &ndash; we can be revived and unite against a clearly defined enemy.&rdquo;The City of Ekurhuleni designated April as Chris Hani Month, and also announced in a statement that there will be programmes throughout April to pay tribute to Hani. &ldquo;Hani unashamedly spoke against socio-economic injustices and the perennial marginalisation of the majority. To pay tribute, the City continues to deliver services providing decent housing, primary healthcare, and working tirelessly to alleviate hunger,&rdquo; the statement said. Hunger, health and housing were Hani&rsquo;s &ldquo;primary issues&rdquo;. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba is expected to give a memorial lecture tonight at the Boksburg Civic Centre, narrating Hani&rsquo;s life.Hani joined the SACP in 1961. He was also a former uMkhonto weSizwe commander.Others took to Twitter today to remember Hani.
