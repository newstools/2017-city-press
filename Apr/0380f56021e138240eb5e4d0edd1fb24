Jacques Rossouw, who works in the Sappi building in Braamfontein, alerted City Press to the fire at about 2pm. &ldquo;We just heard someone saying there was a fire and when we looked out of the window we could see the fire from our building,&rdquo; Rossouw said. People had already begun evacuating the building. By 4pm traffic was being diverted from Rissik Street on to Joubert Street and Hoof Street was blocked off in order for the emergency services to douse the fire.A massive fire has broken out at a Braamfontein office park.
