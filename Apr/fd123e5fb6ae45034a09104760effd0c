Durban mayor and ANC eThekwini chairperson Zandile Gumede has called on media houses to retract stories stating that she had called the anti-Jacob Zuma marches planned for Friday treason and threatened to have marchers arrested.This morning, radio stories claiming that Gumede had made the threats in an interview on the sidelines of an African safer cities initiative held in Durban yesterday in response to questions regarding the political situation in South Africa.Her spokesperson, Mthunzi Gumede, said the mayor &ldquo;refutes claims that she will unleash all security agencies on those participating in the march in Durban against President Jacob Zuma&rdquo;.&ldquo;Yesterday, at the summit, Mayor Gumede called on those who want to march in support of or against President Zuma to follow proper procedures and apply with authorities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The widely published, sensationalised comments [from] various news agencies are a total fabrication and a distortion of her public message.&rdquo;Gumede said the mayor had called on all agencies that ran the story to retract it.In a sound clip, which the city provided to City Press, Gumede tells the interviewer that illegal marches in the city were &ldquo;not called for&rdquo; (at 1:50).&ldquo;In fact these marches that are not legal are not called for. I will tell the community to refrain from these nasty marches,&rdquo; she said, adding that &ldquo;you must follow proper channels&rdquo; and apply for permission.The Democratic Alliance in the city had secured permission for its march to the City Hall, which will start at the circus site near the Suncoast Casino at 9am, while the ANC Youth League has also, according to city officials, been given permission to hold a march in the CBD on Friday.On Wednesday, Cosatu in the province said it would not back the march, while members of the ANC&rsquo;s uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans&rsquo; Association held a press briefing announce its intention to mobilise &ldquo;combat ready&rdquo; former guerrillas to &ldquo;defend&rdquo; both the ANC&rsquo;s Johannesburg headquarters, Luthuli House and Seme House, despite the fact that neither was the target of an opposition-led march.City communications head Tozi Mthethwa said permission had been granted for both the DA march and a second ANC Youth League march in the city centre.&ldquo;In order to ensure the safety of residents and those taking part in the march, metro police officers will be visible along march routes. "Our officers will be on high alert for illegal marches or volatile situations that might arise."Those taking part in the marches are cautioned against injuring others and vandalising infrastructure,&rdquo; she said.
