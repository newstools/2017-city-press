The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro municipality has approved the application for the Zuma Must Fall gathering to be held in the Vuyisile Mini Square precinct on Friday.The gathering, which will be one of many marches across South Africa is anticipated to bring together thousands of supporters for the campaign, in an effort to force President Jacob Zuma to step down as president of South Africa.Save SA held another gathering that drew about 4000 supporters and filled up the front of City Hall on Tuesday.Speaking to the City Press, Eastern Cape convener Mkhuseli Jack was excited at the news that their application for a public gathering was approved.This meant that there would be no arrests for people gathering on Friday afternoon.&ldquo;Our gathering is now official, we have the licence to gather the thousands of people we are expecting,&rdquo; said Jack.&ldquo;We were worried because we want a peaceful gathering that will speak to the foundation of Save SA,&rdquo; he said.He said the campaign had a bright future and would prove to South Africans that action does have a great effect.&ldquo;We cannot just sit back and hope for a miracle without taking a stand to change our circumstances ...The event will be suitable for everyone, from senior citizens to bosses and employees. Everybody is welcome to join us in defence of the country.&rdquo;The Port Elizabeth chapter was the second of all the chapters in the country to have its licence approved for the planned protests.Pretoria&rsquo;s application was approved earlier in the week.&ldquo;There are many other activities taking place tomorrow, from marches to motorcades,&rdquo; said Jack.&ldquo;We want to put it categorically that not every planned action is ours,&rdquo; he said.He said the gathering to be held on Friday will begin at 1pm at the Vuyisile Mini Square, in front of the city hall.On Tuesday, former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas was one of the scheduled speakers at the gathering, but plans changed, and he didn&rsquo;t speakSave SA leader, Sipho Pityana said the rallies were not against the ANC.&ldquo;Zuma has arrogated to himself alone a prerogative and an illegitimate right to sell our hard-won freedom and self-determination to the Guptas in exchange for money for himself and his family,&rdquo; said Pityana.&ldquo;We will not allow that,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are against Zuma, who ousted former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, together with five other ministers in a late-night Cabinet reshuffle,&rdquo; said Pityana.
