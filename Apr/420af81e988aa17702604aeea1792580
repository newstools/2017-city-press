President Jacob Zuma has used a remembrance service for ANC members who died in the struggle, held at the University of Zululand near Richards Bay, to punt his administration&rsquo;s rapid socioeconomic transformation policy.Zuma &ndash; accompanied by ANC national executive committee member Nomvula Mokonyane and KwaZulu-Natal ANC chairperson Sihle Zikalala, as well as leaders of the Musa Dladala (KwaZulu-Natal North Coast) region &ndash; said that while those who had given up their lives had helped secure political freedom, it was now time to complete their task and secure economic liberation.Addressing the Siyabakhumbula Commemoration, Zuma said that it was important to pay respects to those who had lost their lives in the province in the state-sponsored violence between the United Democratic Front/ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party during the 1980s and the 1990s. Zuma said many families from the region had lost their lives in the &ldquo;black-on-black violence&rdquo; that had been orchestrated by the apartheid regime to try to destabilise the liberation movement. Others had loved ones thrown in jail and tortured. Others were buried in unmarked graves.Zuma told the thousands of ANC supporters bused in from throughout the region, which incorporates the towns of Richards Bay and Empangeni and stretches westwards to Eshowe, that their contributions had brought about political freedom.&ldquo;Yes, we do have political power ... [but] we don&rsquo;t have economic power.&ldquo;A few in our country are controlling the largest part of our economy. Their numbers are very few,&rdquo; said Zuma.These groups were responsible for the &ldquo;monopolisation of the economy&rdquo;.The 5 000-seater Bhekuzulu Hall was silent as Zuma outlined a history of the policy, which he said had first been discussed at the policy conference ahead of the ANC&rsquo;s 2012 elective conference in Mangaung.&ldquo;This is a fundamental change in the structure, systems, nature and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans, the majority of whom are African and female,&rdquo; Zuma said.&ldquo;It is a well-thought-out programme that comes after years of other attempts to change the economy,&rdquo; Zuma said.He said since 1994, successive governments had tried to change the economy and failed.Rapid economic transformation, Zuma said, would ensure that the wealth of the country was spread out between black and white and to all people.Zuma said there were people who were attempting to control South Africa through trying to control the ANC, but that they would fail.Zikalala in turn said that his province would approach the policy conference with serious proposals to change the economy, including expropriation of land, as the willing-buyer-willing-seller system had been &ldquo;frustrated&rdquo; by sellers.&ldquo;We want the land,&rdquo; Zikalala said.KwaZulu-Natal would also propose that 51% of all goods exported from South African ports must be carried by South African vessels and that 50% of all government expenditure on procurement should go to black businesses.Zikalala said Zuma had driven the attempts to change the economy because he was a &ldquo;decisive&rdquo; leader who had provided key interventions in the peace process and the fight against HIV/Aids.
