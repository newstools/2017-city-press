Johannesburg may be known for its high crime rate, but now a major sports brand is taking the initiative to empower women by giving them free self-defence classes.Reebok South Africa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pretty Lethal&rdquo; campaign aims to &ldquo;[educate] women across the country with the necessary tools to walk tall, with confidence, by learning the basics of self-defence&rdquo;.Reebok brand director Peter-John Morrily said although a self-defence class would not change the crime statistics in South Africa, the classes would give women a sense of empowerment.&ldquo;Our goal, first and foremost, is to support women across South Africa. We can&rsquo;t control the negative forces in our country. But what we can do is provide the tools and knowledge that give our women a fighting chance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about overcoming fear and being able to walk around with dignity, self-confidence, and above all, pride,&rdquo; he said.Educate, elevate and inspire.
