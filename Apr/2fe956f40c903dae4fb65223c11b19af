Ever more consumers are using online methods to apply for credit, debt counselling and to access credit reports, which is providing new channels for scammers and fraudulent operators. This is according to Nomsa Motshegare, CEO of the National Credit Regulator (NCR), which, together with the National Consumer Commission (NCC), will this month focus on educating consumers about their rights and responsibilities as per the amended National Credit Act. This includes misleading advertising with a focus on SMS and online credit; debt counselling scams; and informing consumers about the dangers of using unregistered credit providers. Motshegare says consumers who are applying for credit online should only apply to credit providers who are registered with the NCR. They can verify the credit provider’s registration with the NCR by checking if their name and registration number are the same as that which appears on the NCR’s website. Alternatively, consumers can also call the NCR to verify the credit provider’s details. NCC commissioner Ebrahim Mohamed says technology has created various opportunities for businesses and customers alike, however, he says consumers should be mindful of the risks associated with doing transactions over the internet or the telephone. He warns consumers to listen carefully when they transact over the telephone, and to report suspicious telephone and online marketers to the NCC on 012 428 7000. WHAT NOT TO DO:
