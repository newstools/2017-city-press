President Jacob Zuma celebrated his 75th birthday in Kliptown on Wednesday. Zuma, speaking in Zulu at the ANC organised celebration event, said his age was only a number because he was still going strong. During his time in the ANC Zuma said he had seen a lot of backstabbing in the party and it would take a lot to hurt him, including being called names. &ldquo;In my time serving the ANC, [I have] seen some turn into cowards and some turn against what they had been fighting for,&rdquo; he said. Our photographers Leon Sadiki and Jacquelyn Guillen captured the big day.
