British Prime Minister Theresa May has called for a snap general election on June 8, three years before the next scheduled vote. The shock decision was taken at a weekly Cabinet meeting this morning. May said that the only way for Britain to guarantee certainty and security for years ahead is to hold this election . This was ahead of Britain s negotiations as they chart a way forward out of the European Union. In a statement outside 10 Downing Street, May accused opposition parties of not palying ball during the Brexit talks. The country is coming together but Westminster is not, May quipped, going on to explain how the various parties have categorically stated their dismay with the government s handling of Brexit. In recent weeks Labour have threatened to vote against the final agreement we reached with the European Union. The Liberal Democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standstill. However, the British Parliament will first have to vote tomorrow on whether they would want a snap election or not before it is made official. Under current legislation, the next election was scheduled for 2020 but a vote can be called before then if it is backed by two thirds of MPs or if there is a no confidence vote in the government.Challenging the opposition parties to bring their A-game, May said that this is the moment to show that you do not treat politics as a game . Let s tomorrow vote for an election let s put forward our plans for Brexit and our alternative programmes for government and then let the people decide.
