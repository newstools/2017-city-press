The Democratic Alliance has called newly appointed Police Minister Fikile Mbalula&rsquo;s &ldquo;fight fire with fire&rdquo; comments &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo;, saying that they threaten the safety of South Africans.&ldquo;If they come with AK47s, we must outgun them. Meet fire with fire. You are not given those guns as toys. You are given those guns to use them, to protect the nation and protect yourselves,&rdquo; Mbalula said.The minister was giving his first address to South African Police Service (SAPS) officials at a welcoming parade at the SAPS training college in Pretoria West on Tuesday.WATCH: Killing cops must end #jindaTsotsi #SAPS pic.twitter.com/6GYnrLTvvx The DA said that Mbalula&rsquo;s comments were reckless &ldquo;and could result in loss of life, including the lives of police members and innocent bystanders&rdquo;.Some echoed the DA&rsquo;s sentiments, concerned about the ministers comments.V concerned by #Mbalula address to SAPS today.Doesnt appear to worry about police violence but almost implicitly incited it. #Mbalula is instructing police to be hard on criminals without adequate training? #MbalulaPresser pic.twitter.com/OYyPfwtV0L Guys are thinking that our lives are a Contra4 game on a Golden China console #Mbalula ??????&zwj;?? pic.twitter.com/Ed19VYomQs Spokesperson Esethu Hasane said that he had not seen the DA&rsquo;s statement and could therefore not comment.&ldquo;What I can say is that what the minister was saying is that police are constitutionally allowed to protect themselves and citizens. &ldquo;When criminals are heavily armed, the police are in a position to defend themselves within the confines of the law. The minister was speaking within the constitutional framework,&rdquo; Hasane said.Mbalula also issued a warning to violent protesters, telling them not to damage property during demonstrations because he didn&rsquo;t want to see a repeat of the Marikana massacre.&ldquo;We must educate our people because I don&rsquo;t want another Marikana here where police opened fire and people died.&rdquo;#mbalula, the minister of police has already started protecting the Mr Zuma. nw we aren't supposed to protest because they'll kill us :? Did hear #Mbalula threatening protestors? So If protesters r violent he will give us another #Marikana? Okay kill us. @RediTlhabi @Radio702 It is despicable for #Mbalula to invoke Marikana while threatening protesters. Sad day! The DA said that both Mbalula, and his deputy, Bongani Mkongi, were unfit to head the ministry and that they would submit parliamentary questions to find out exactly how much money was spent on the parade.&ldquo;The DA will not stand by while money that should be spent on equipping the SAPS and making South Africans safe is wasted on feeding Mbalula&rsquo;s ego,&rdquo; the party said.
