What is behind the leaked emailed notes from the ANC&rsquo;s national working committee on Tuesday night?The notes reveal the tensions with the party but indicate a sentiment of overall support for embattled president Jacob Zuma. They were sent out on the party&rsquo;s email media list but then immediately retracted as &ldquo;erroneous communication&rdquo;.Political analyst Daniel Silke cautioned that trying to interpret the leak was impossible and could only be speculative.However, he then ventured that it was likely to have emanated from an ANC member frustrated at the attempt to retain the status quo with Zuma.&ldquo;A leak is either deliberate &ndash; to show where a process is going, though in this case, there is no need for that as a press conference was being called, or it is to embarrass. If the anti-Zuma faction leaked it, that would undermine the integrity of the meeting.&rdquo;It was unlikely that the email was sent out by somebody in error, as the ANC had tried to claim, said Silke.The action appeared to be deliberate. &ldquo;It looks as though it came from those frustrated with the current process, and the likely inability to act against Zuma,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The leak is of no benefit for those determined to retain the status quo.&rdquo;One thing that was clear was that the leak demonstrated the deep divisions within the party and the polarising effect that the Cabinet reshuffle was having on the ANC. &ldquo;It is increasingly difficult for the ANC to keep control of the most secret deliberations such as within the working committee. This indicates the deep internal polarisation of the party, and damages the ability of the party to meet in private.&rdquo;&bull; Change of leadership and attendant issues; &bull; Officials managing working committee, defence of the ANC where national office fails, officials&rsquo; apologies for display of disunity, using the Constitution where it suits them, explain your ill-discipline;&bull; Condemn behaviour of South African Communist Party and Congress of South African Trade Unions;&bull; Comrade Ahmed Kathrada&rsquo;s funeral &ndash; manner in which some national executive committee members and ministers behaved;&bull; Mobilising by Comrade Pravin [Gordhan];&bull; Behaviour of alliance partners hurting the organisation;&bull; How do we deal with some of our comrades becoming part of a force united against us?&bull; Sustained contestation over the ANC and Treasury;&bull; Unfortunate actions of the integrity commission; and&bull; Prevailing contradictions. South Africa&rsquo;s problem is a class struggle. Removal of the president will not resolve such contradictions Shortly after the notes were sent, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa issued an email to say that the notes should not be used for the purposes of reporting because they amounted to &ldquo;erroneous communication&rdquo;. The ANC was due to hold a media briefing at 11am to announce the outcomes of the national working committee meeting.
