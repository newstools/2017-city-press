An estimated 400 people, led by the Democratic Alliance, took part in the protest against President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s presidency in Mpumalanga's capital city of Mbombela today.The peaceful march started on the R40 and ended at the Mbombela Rugby Stadium where Mpumalanga DA leader, James Masango, addressed the crowd.The DA claims it distributed 2 000 party t-shirts to the crowds.&ldquo;Today is a defining moment in the history of our country. We are gathered here today to send a strong message to the ANC, President Jacob Zuma and his Gupta handlers, that the people reject the hijacking of our democratic project to pursue a self-enrichment campaign by raiding our Treasury and the state,&rdquo; Masango said.Masango also diverted attention to Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza, whom he accused of showing his own political interests as being more important than the welfare of ordinary citizens.&ldquo;(Mabuza) has unleashed a reign of terror in Bushbuckridge where communities are being terrorized, allegedly by Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association members to dissuade them from protesting against poor service delivery in the area,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;There is no difference between Mabuza and Zuma. He has threatened ANC MPs who might vote with the opposition in the no confidence vote in Parliament on April 18. He has also rebuked political principals for speaking out against Zuma&rsquo;s recklessness,&rdquo; Masango said.
