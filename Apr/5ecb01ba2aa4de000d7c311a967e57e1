The most important event following the 2016 local government elections is the presidential local government summit, according to Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen.President Jacob Zuma will host the two-day summit &ndash; which starts tomorrow &ndash; as part of the government&rsquo;s efforts to strengthen the system of local government as part of the Back to Basics programme. This is the third summit of its kind.This programme was put in place in an attempt to address existing challenges in local government. Van Rooyen listed Nelson Mandela Bay, Buffalo City, Thabazimbi, Oudtshoorn and Mogalakwena as municipalities that have received additional support from the government.The key challenges at local government level mentioned by Van Rooyen include dysfunctional settlement, increasing the provision of electricity across the country &ndash; including in informal settlements, which face the continual risk of fires &ndash; and debt owed to municipalities.Van Rooyen said the objective of the summit was to continue with the Back to Back programme, which was launched at the second presidential local government summit in 2014, to strengthen the system of local government.He added that the government was looking to advance radical social and economic transformation at a local government level.&ldquo;Spatial planning is essential to realising socioeconomic transformation&rdquo; said Van Rooyen.On one of the two days of the summit there will be three intergovernmental and stakeholder panel discussions.
