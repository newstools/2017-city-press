The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has urged bus companies to negotiate with them before tonight or risk a national driver&rsquo;s strike tomorrow.Sixteen different trade unions have been working together to lobby employer associations for a living wage and for improved working conditions for bus drivers, but mediation attempts by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) have recently reached an impasse.&ldquo;We have been in negotiations since late February. We have been talking since then to find a middle ground,&rdquo; said Phakamile Hlubi, the acting national spokesperson for Numsa.&ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t get a satisfactory response.&rdquo;According to a press statement released by Numsa, bus drivers are not being treated as humans and are often forced to work 16-hour shifts and &ldquo;dangerously long hours, with no regard for family time, or rest and relaxation time&rdquo;.Numsa are also demanding a 15% salary increase to allow for a living wage for workers and for them to be paid overtime, as stipulated by the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.According to Hlubi, the decision to strike was not taken lightly.&ldquo;This is a no work, no pay situation. When workers take to the streets and are protesting, they are desperate,&rdquo; said Hlubi.&ldquo;They are receiving no income and that has a massive impact on their daily lives. If employers care at all for their workers, they will negotiate. We would prefer to avert a strike and we hope to find a resolution.&rdquo;According to Meko Magida, the national spokesperson for the bus employer associations, there is no official response at this time. However, Magida emphasised the employer associations&rsquo; willingness to negotiate.&ldquo;We want to appeal to labour to come forward to engage with us so that we can come to a reasonable agreement,&rdquo; Magida said.&ldquo;We are ready. We are willing and available at all times. We want to save the business and we want to save jobs.&rdquo;If no agreement is reached, the bus companies that will be affected by the strike include Putco, Mgqibelo, Mayibuye, Buscor, Golden Arrow, Megabus, Mega Express, Bojanala, Gauteng Coaches, Itereleng, Ipelegeng, Atamelang, Autopax, Great North Transport, ReaVaya, Phola Coaches, PAL Bus and Greyhound.Transportation for tomorrow&rsquo;s anti-Zuma protest and for the Easter weekend will also be affected by the strike.Numsa has advised commuters to make alternative travel arrangements for the weekend because buses will not be operational.No negotiations were underway at the time of punlishing.
