On Monday the court declared that section 18 of the act was inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid, to the extent that it barred the right to institute a prosecution for all sexual offences &ndash; other than those listed in section 18 &ndash; after 20 years had passed since the time of the offence. The court said the declaration of constitutional invalidity had been suspended for a period of 18 months, in order to allow Parliament to remedy the constitutional defect.&nbsp; Ian Levitt, representing the victims known as the Frankel 8, said they would now approach the Constitutional Court &ndash; which is the highest court in the land &ndash; to confirm the order.&nbsp; The Women&rsquo;s Legal Centre, The Teddy Bear Clinic and Lawyers for Human Rights were supporting the Frankel 8&rsquo;s case in the matter. The eight people claimed they were sexually assaulted by Frankel as long ago as 30 years before his death.

He was 68.Under the current law, the right to initiate prosecution lapses after 20 years for crimes of sexual assault.
