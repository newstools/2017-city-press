President Jacob Zuma is currently busy consulting with legal advisers to find ways of setting up a commission of inquiry into state capture, said Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.&nbsp; Ramaphosa was responding to a question from the ANC&rsquo;s Mondli Gungubele who asked him how government intends on restoring confidence in state-owned entities, following reports of state capture by corporates.Ramaphosa said he personally supports an independent judicial inquiry into allegations of state capture so that the veracity of the claims can be tested and those implicated have an opportunity to clear their names.&ldquo;State capture in any form is abhorrent and should not be tolerated by South Africans,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Much evidence has been published about the undue influence of some people who have been found to have had undue influence regarding a number of institutions of state in relation to non-transparent appointments and procurement decisions. These allegations are clearly of grave concern to many South Africans.&rdquo;&ldquo;It is in the interest of all South Africans that such a commission is established as quickly as possible so that all those with evidence can present it to competent body and those implicated have an opportunity to respond to the allegations against them,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said. The country&rsquo;s law enforcement agencies, such as the directorate for priority crime and investigation has already started work on the allegations, he added. &ldquo;Where crimes have been committed those responsible must be brought to book. But one of pillars of democracy in South Africa is that we are regulated by the rule of law. The law should be allowed to take its course without fear or favour.&rdquo; Ramaphosa also emphasised that the inter-ministerial committee on state-owned entities are continuing its work to reform state-owned enterprises. Alongside this work government is paying attention to strengthening these enterprises. One of the recommendations is overarching state-owned enterprises legislation that will improve oversight and ensure more effective deployment and management of the financial resources allocated to them. &ldquo;That should reduce the potential for [these enterprises] to be captured by corporates and private interests.&rdquo;
