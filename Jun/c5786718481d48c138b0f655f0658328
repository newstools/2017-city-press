The Food and Allied Workers Union has decided to suspend the strike action involving about 1000 Illovo workers after the company agreed to have negotiations over a disputed list of demands. The union’s general secretary, Katishi Masemola, said although the union had issued a 48-hour strike notice on Tuesday morning it would not be activating it, pending talks with the company on Friday. Among the demands the union is making is a 10% wage hike. The company has so far offered a 5% increase, provident fund for seasonal and full-time workers, union group scheme contribution of R20 by the employers, 50% maternity leave for all workers, bonus payment scheme as well as regular free protective clothing. Illovo confirmed that it received the strike notice but the strike action had been halted. “The company is now in receipt of a strike notice but the workers are not presently embarking on any strike action. "Management and the union have agreed to meet on Friday to resolve the dispute,” the statement read. The workers affected are in eight of Illovo’s KwaZulu-Natal farms and, should the strike go ahead, it might have devastating consequences for the giant sugar producer.
