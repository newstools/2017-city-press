South Africa’s national coach Stuart Baxter has named a strong line up against Nigeria’s Super Eagles tomorrow afternoon (6pm SA time). Itumeleng Khune will man the goals, while Bafana Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo will be controlling the defence with Eric Mathoho, Tebogo Langerman and Ramahlwe Mphahlele. SuperSport United captain Dean Furman will play in the heart of the midfield, together with Portugal-based Bongani Zungu. Keagan Dolly and Themba Zwane will play in the wings and Sibusiso Vilakazi will support the returning Tokelo Rantie up front. Baxter said this was the strongest possible team and was hoping they would put pressure on the hosts in South Africa’s opening 2019 African Cup of Nations qualifier. The Bafana coach said his aim was to close all the gaps and hit Nigeria on quick counter attacks. “We should not hold back and should turn the screws on them early on. We respect them but not scared of them,” Baxter said. Kermit Erasmus has been ruled out of the game with a knock. Bafana substitutes are: Darren Keet, Lorenzo Gordinho, Abbubaker Mobara, Tiyani Mabunda, Andile Jali, Percy Tau and Lebogang Manyama. Follow @TimSpiritMolobi as he covers the game from Uyo, Nigeria
