South African businessman Mthunzi Mdwaba has been elected as vice-president for the International Labour Organisation (ILO) governing body and will serve as its global spokesperson for employers. The ILO is an United Nations agency that brings together governments, employers and workers’ representatives of 187 different countries to set labour standards. Mdwaba was elected at the International Organisation of Employers Governing Body meeting, held on June 16 in Geneva, Switzerland, as part of the ILO’s annual labour conference. It is the first time the ILO has an African as its employer spokesperson. Mdwaba is the founder and CEO of TZoro IBC; the chairperson of the board of governors of the University of the Western Cape; chairperson of Productivity SA and B20 Co-Chairperson for the Task Force on Employment & Education. “I am extremely honoured and humbled by the confidence shown to me by businesspeople and employers from all corners of the world to represent our interests at this level. This is also testimony to the rise and influence Africa has in international matters,” said Mdwaba in a statement. The governing body of the ILO also elected Luc Cortebeeck, President of the Workers’ Group and Vice-President of the ILO Governing Body since 2011, as chairperson until 2018. Luis Enrique Chávez Basagoitia, ambassador and permanent representative of Peru to the ILO in Geneva, was elected as government vice-chairperson. Catelene Passchier, until recently vice president of the Netherlands Trade Union Confederation (FNV), was appointed as worker spokesperson. The chairperson and two-vice chairpersons will serve as officers of the governing body until 2018.
