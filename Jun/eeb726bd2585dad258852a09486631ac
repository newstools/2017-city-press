Activists are pinning their hope on the South Gauteng High Court case examining an application to set aside the law that puts an &ldquo;expiry date&rdquo; on opening a case of indecent and sexual assault against perpetrators.The court heard last week that this law was harmful and disadvantageous to the victims, who wish to see perpetrators brought to book no matter how long it took to file a case with police and charge them. The matter was brought to court by Nicole Levenstein and others who alleged that Sidney Frankel committed a range of sexual offences against the applicants between 1976 and 1991.The issue of the prescription of sexual assault (the expiry date on the time on which a person can report a matter to the police) comes at a time when South Africa is experiencing a scourge of brutal rape and murder of women and children.If the court rules in favour of the applicants, victims who were abused more than two decades ago would have the opportunity to open a case against their violators irrespective of the time that had lapsed.Currently, section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act states that if 20 years have lapsed after the incident, the victim cannot open a case against the alleged perpetrator.The Women&rsquo;s Legal Centre (WLC) which appeared as a &ldquo;friend of the court&rdquo; (amicus curiae) described the prescription of sexual assault as unconstitutional.Advocate Bronwyn Pithey, a legal consultant at WLC said: &ldquo;no sexual offence should have an expiry date&rdquo;.&ldquo;Rape and any other form of sexual assault is a traumatic experience and should not be treated differently.&ldquo;The law must take into account that a delay in reporting sexual offences is a common occurrence which is often caused by fear of reprisal from the perpetrator, self-blame and lack of support from family and community members,&rdquo; she explained.Although the sexual offences were of a nature that did not constitute rape, they were indecent assaults on them. Although the sexual offences law was changed in 2007 by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act to broaden the definition of rape (the common law limited rape to vaginal penetration by a penis) to include both anal and oral penetration, section 18 still limits the prosecution of other sexual offences, for example sexual assault, exposing a child to pornography and certain trafficking offences involving sexual offences.The WLC argued in court that the current law arbitrarily distinguishes between rape and other sexual offences, assuming that rape is more serious.It said the concept of seriousness based on &ldquo;harm&rdquo; or moral gravity does not take into account the level of trauma endured by survivors of sexual offences which varies independently of the &ldquo;seriousness&rdquo; of the offence. &ldquo;This concept of &ldquo;seriousness&rdquo; is linked to patriarchal notions and assumptions that penetrative sexual offences are more serious (and should be excluded from prescription) than non-penetrative sexual offences,&rdquo; explained Pithey.She said if everybody was equal under the Constitution in South Africa, then &ldquo;victims of sexual assault irrespective of when it happened should not be treated less seriously because sexual assault is as traumatic as penetrative rape. It&rsquo;s absurd that only rape is protected in this way.&rdquo;Pithey said the changing of this law was urgently needed in South Africa as it will not only encourage victims to report such case but &ldquo;send a strong message to perpetrators that no matter how long ago you committed a crime you&rsquo;ll face the law&rdquo;.The South Gauteng High Court is yet to hand down a judgment on this case. The matter would then be sent to the Constitutional Court for confirmation.
