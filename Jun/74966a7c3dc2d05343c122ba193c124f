Botswana has entered a three-day period of mourning after the death of former president Sir Ketumile Masire, who was 91. Masire, who was president of Botswana from 1980 to 1988, was only the second president of the state. Tributes have been pouring in, with South Africa&rsquo;s high commissioner to Botswana, Mdu Lembede, saying that Masire was &ldquo;instrumental in the fight against apartheid&rdquo;.During the struggle, Masire allowed the Pan African Congress&rsquo;s military wing, the Azanian People&rsquo;s Liberation Army, enter the borders of Botswana in order to access other countries such as Lusaka, Harare, Tanzania and Ghana. &ldquo;We are thankful for the revolutionary and courageous contribution that Sir Masire displayed in his entire life to help not only Botswana but this beloved country to realise its liberty. "Africa is not where we want to see it but Sir Masire and his generation rescued Africa from imperial forces,&rdquo; PAC spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe said. The Nelson Mandela Foundation was saddened by Masire&rsquo;s death, and said the world had lost &ldquo;another great leader&rdquo;. The foundation referred to a state banquet which was held for Masire on April 23 1996, when Nelson Mandela said: &ldquo;Our country has much to learn from Botswana &ndash; both from your towering successes and your efforts to deal with the difficulties. &ldquo;All these attributes have made Botswana, and you, Mr President, a natural and capable leader of the region&rsquo;s collective efforts towards growth and development, within the framework of SADC. "We also value your leadership in the region&rsquo;s efforts to promote peace and stability on our sub-continent and further afield.&rdquo;A memorial Service will be held in Gaborone next Wednesday, and a state funeral was set to take place on Thursday.
