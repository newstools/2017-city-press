There are way too many inspiring projects from the J&B Hive Community to mention here, but these are a few of the standout projects on our radar: Townships are the birthplace of street culture in South Africa – a fitting home for 26-year-old Theo Baloyi, who used the story of his life in Alexandra as the inspiration for Bathu, his own line of footwear. The mesh sneakers, available in a series of colours with colourful soles, is the sort of pared-down aesthetic that normally costs a fortune when imported, however, when they are made locally, they come in at a relatively affordable R800. The breathable mesh also makes for a cooler foot, which is rarely catered for in an African climate.  Tshepo “The Jean Maker” Mohlala (25) from Lydenburg already has a loyal following for his young denim label, which got its start last year. Things are escalating as the designer – who “chose to specialise in denim because of its distinctly nostalgic character, which guides much of my design process” – is growing his business as he moves into the difficult market of women’s wear. This shouldn’t be hard for Mohlala, whose Presidential Slim Fit and Commuters Jeans lines are already fan favourites among the hipster-ati. We all love a white sneaker, but there’s always that nagging voice in your head, probably coming from an actual mother’s nag when you were younger, that “your shoes will always look dirty”. But there’s a solution at hand. Walk Fresh is an initiative developed by Daveyton-born Lethabo Mpho Mokoena that is “serious about shoe care”. His ingenious boutique sneaker cleaning and shoe-care service provides “the best sneaker cleaning, suede/nubuck refurbishing and maintenance, shoe shining and repair service for all footwear brands, makes and materials”.
