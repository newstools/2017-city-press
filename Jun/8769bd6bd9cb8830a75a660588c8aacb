Former North West public works MEC Madoda Sambatha, who was fired by Premier Supra Mahumapelo, has cried foul over his sacking which has seen battles lines becoming more visible along factional divisions influenced by the looming ANC presidential race.The ANC in the province said Sambatha was relieved of his duties in a decision based on allegations of fraudulent sale of government land. Sambatha &ndash; an SA Communist Party North West provincial secretary &ndash; has recently made clear his party&rsquo;s support for Cyril Ramaphosa to be the next ANC president and subsequently succeed President Jacob Zuma as the state president.North West ANC chairperson and premier Mahumapelo has been linked with the campaign for former AU commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to succeed her ex-husband.In a letter addressed to the ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte, Sambatha said allegations of dubious land sale were used to get him out of the way.&ldquo;What is clear is that my political difference with comrades is not engaged politically but they use state institutions and state executive authority to make me feel the political difference. Why would the ANC leadership in government be preoccupied (with) investigating or finding fault with one of their deployees as if I&rsquo;m from the opposition?&rdquo; Sambatha wrote in a letter which City Press is in possession of.&ldquo;One sits in a meeting with people who are investigating him and all that is informed by political hatred. If there were grounds or necessity without grounds to reshuffle me, why is this not done and that comrades just stop wanting to reshuffle me through incrimination and in all the instances comrades acting like investigation officers and political leadership concurrently?&rdquo;The ANC in the North West said on Friday that it has &ldquo;received a comprehensive report from Premier Supra Mahumapelo on Monday last week regarding allegations of fraudulent sale of government land against MEC Sambatha&rdquo;. &ldquo;The PEC officials then met Sambatha the following day. In that meeting he acknowledged that indeed the fraudulent document bore his signature and he said he was misled,&rdquo; the party said.The ANC provincial secretary, Dakota Legoete, further showed City Press documents with Sambatha&rsquo;s signature on the sale of land, rezoning and transfer of ownership. The land in question is an open space in Unit 12, Mahikeng. The land owner, appearing as TJ Mampe on documents in possession of City Press, bought it for R76 000 but he would not comment on the matter when called.A director for MEC support in Sambatha&rsquo;s office, George Madoda, told City Press that Sambatha was being framed for something he did not do.&ldquo;Sambatha signed the right documents which are now being presented in a disorderly manner to make it appear as if he committed fraud. The fraud was manufactured by those who wanted him out,&rdquo; Madoda said.Meanwhile, Sambatha reiterated that the move to fire him was based on nothing but political differences. He told City Press to await the pronouncement of the SACP on the matter.Meanwhile, Cosatu and the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) in the province said as alliance partners they were not consulted over Sambatha&rsquo;s axing.Provicial secretary of Sanco, Packet Seaketso, said Sambatha has asked for the allegations to be investigated but this was ignored. &ldquo;There is inconsistency in how these cases are handled in that agriculture MEC Manketse Tlhape remains in her position despite serious allegations against her being probed by the Parliament portfolio committee on a questionable donation of wildlife animals to some people in the province. It is clear that anyone with a descending view against Mahumapelo will be dealt with in what the latter has termed political suffocation ... Sambatha is innocent until a proper investigation suggests otherwise,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, a fortnight ago in Rustenburg during an SACP event attended by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Sambatha told the audience the party would back Ramaphosa to succeed Zuma at the upcoming ANC national elective conference in December.City Press heard that Mahumapelo only informed ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte about his plans to fire Sambatha &ndash; previously believed to enjoy the support of Duarte&rsquo;s principal, Gwede Mantashe.A senior party source said Duarte called Sambatha to Luthuli House on Monday to inform him about the reshuffle, and the two were joined by ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize.On Monday Mantashe had to report back to the media on the ANC national executive committee meeting held last weekend. Mahumapelo had also consulted SACP chairperson Senzeni Zokwana, City Press heard.Legoete said the North West ANC top five met Sambatha on Wednesday and indicated that he must &ldquo;resign from his position [or] the Premier must release him&rdquo;.&ldquo;A wider investigation must be undertaken, looking into other land transactions,&rdquo; he said, adding that Sambatha should also &ldquo;be taken through an ANC disciplinary process&rdquo;.Sambatha told City Press that he was innocent and he called for an investigation into the alleged fraudulent land sale. He said he had signed the right papers meant to get the land rezoned as privately-owned so that government can stop paying for its municipal rates.
