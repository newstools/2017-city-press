A 17-year-old girl who fatally stabbed a man who wanted to rape her in Sofaya Village, Limpopo, is due to appear in court tomorrow.Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the teenager was on her way to the local tavern in the village near Tzaneen at around 1am when the man attempted to rape her but she overpowered him, disarmed him of his knife and stabbed him to death.Ngoepe said she would appear in the Lenyenye Magistrates&rsquo; Court on a charge of murder and full details of the case would be known tomorrow.&ldquo;We have probation officers, social workers and the National Prosecuting Authority working on the case,&rdquo; he said.Ngoepe added that parents also have a responsibility towards the whereabouts of their children.&ldquo;Parents have to account to the whereabouts of their children. Where was she going at that time [of night]?&rdquo; Ngoepe said. He cautioned girls against walking alone in dangerous areas.&ldquo;Take into consideration the scourge of rapes and the current things happening to young women and girls.&ldquo;There is an ongoing appeal [also] for men to stop following women and raping them. Real men cannot rape and real men don&rsquo;t kill,&rdquo; Ngoepe added.A report tabled by the Commission for Gender Equality titled Struggling to meet the ends of justice: Assessing Departmental Responses to [Commission] findings on the Victims Charter found that on average only one in every 6.5 police stations in South Africa had family violence, child protection and sexual offence (FCS) units. &ldquo;If we are going to bring down the unacceptably high levels of violence against women and children, we cannot accept that just one FCS unit has to cover 6.5 stations,&rdquo; said DA police spokesperson Zakhele Mbhele.&ldquo;These units are vital because they are the spear head of investigating any reported child abuse or exploitation, rape and domestic abuse, to ensure that victims receive justice for the hurt of the ordeals they have been through at the hands of perpetrators, who are made to face the consequences of their criminality through convictions,&rdquo; he added.Mbhele said he would ask Police Minister Fikile Mbalula account to Parliament for the ongoing gaps in FCS units investigative capacity.
