The leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters, Julius Malema, has laid charges against Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, President Jacob Zuma, the Guptas and &ldquo;crooked&rdquo; members at Transnet for their roles in the inflated R17.5 billion Transnet locomotives tenders. The DA also opened a criminal case &ndash; against deputy finance minister Sfiso Buthelezi, for allegedly benefiting to the tune of R150 million in contracts from the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) while he was chairperson.The EFF&rsquo;s charges were laid today at the Johannesburg Central Police Station.They include fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering. It is alleged that Gigaba was central to the role in the procurement of diesel locomotives by Transnet, particularly after his appointment as public enterprises minister in 2010, when it is alleged that the Gupta family amassed billions after receiving kickbacks for the sale of the locomotives. &ldquo;We have opened a case against Zuma, Gigaba and Gupta crooks who stole R17 billion from Transnet,&rdquo; Malema said. Yesterday the EFF held a press conference where he called Gigaba a &ldquo;facilitator of corruption&rdquo; in state-owned enterprises and said that he was prepared to take Zuma to court. Malema also criticised the Democratic Alliance for failing to suspend Helen Zille as the Western Cape premier. Meanwhile, the DA also opened a criminal case against deputy finance minister Sfiso Buthelezi, for allegedly benefiting to the tune of R150 million in contracts from the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) while he was chairperson, after tenders were awarded to his brother.&ldquo;The DA believes there appears to be a clear case of corruption implicating deputy minister Buthelezi and we therefore laid criminal charges in terms of the Prevention of Combatting of Corrupt Activities Act,&rdquo; DA transport spokesperson Manny de Freitas said. The charges were laid at the Cape Town Central Police this morning. &ldquo;We expect that the South African Police Services will fully and thoroughly investigate this matter so that deputy minister Buthelezi is held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,&rdquo; De Freitas said.
