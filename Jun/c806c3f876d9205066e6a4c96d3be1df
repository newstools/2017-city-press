"It's her judgment call to make" pic.twitter.com/EKQujG2BNG &ldquo;The Speaker says that neither the Constitution nor the rules of the National Assembly allow her to authorise a vote by secret ballot. &ldquo;To this extent, she was mistaken. Our interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution, and the rules make it clear, that the Speaker does have the power to authorise a vote by a secret ballot in a motion of no confidence in the president,&rdquo; Mogoeng said.He added that the court cannot tell the Speaker how to decide and has thrown the ball back in her court.RT @the_pixelat0r: Mogoeng: it would be a violation of separation of powers for the court to order the Speaker to conduct the #SecretBallotMogoeng also ordered the president and the Speaker to incur the legal costs of the case.The matter was brought to the court by the UDM, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Congress of the People (Cope) last month, asking the court to give Parliament the go ahead to vote in secret in a motion of no confidence.The debate around the fifth motion of no confidence was due to begin in April following Zuma&rsquo;s controversial late night Cabinet reshuffle.Mbete postponed the debate on the request of opposition parties to wait on the outcome of the court&rsquo;s decision.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said the party felt vindicated by the judgment and the ruling was a wakeup call to South Africans.RT @the_pixelat0r: #SecretBallot Holomisa: we asked speaker to use her prerogative but she put the interest of her party ahead of Parliament pic.twitter.com/81gWIHwDgZ RT @the_pixelat0r: #SecretBallot Holomisa: you cannot have a questionable character voted into the high office pic.twitter.com/MSYCqZyaTRCope&rsquo;s Mosiuoa Lekota said the ruling was &ldquo;a triumph for democracy&rdquo;.&ldquo;Those of us who are elected and having taken our oath of office, owe it to the people of South Africa as a whole that no political party can compel a Member of Parliament to vote against their conscience and their judgment. &ldquo;They were not free; now they will be free to exercise [their] votes without fear of repercussions,&rdquo; Lekota said.The ANC issued a statement following the ruling and said that it stands against the motion of no confidence against Zuma.MT @AndiMakinana: ANC welcomes ConCourt judgment; reiterates it won't support the motion of no confidence in President Zuma, will defeat it&ldquo;We reiterate our long stated position that we will not support the motion of no confidence on President Jacob Zuma by opposition parties. &ldquo;We will defeat this motion of no confidence by the opposition as we have successfully done so in the previous four motions tabled in this fifth term of Parliament,&rdquo; the ANC said.MT @AndiMakinana: UDM has written to Mbete requesting urgent motion of no confidence debate; asking her to grant secret vote in the motion
