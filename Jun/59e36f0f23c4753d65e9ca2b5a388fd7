About 500 delegates who were set to attend a three-day conference on social cohesion were left scratching their heads after it was cancelled suddenly on Sunday night. The eThekwini municipality had budgeted R2.1 million for the conference, which was set to happen in Durban until June 20. The conference was cancelled by the municipality at around 10pm on Sunday night and left Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi feeling sidelined. The 88-year-old politician was meant to deliver a 40-minute speech at the conference. He believed that ANC members were behind the cancellation, saying that the people of eThekweni were &ldquo;disrespected&rdquo;. &ldquo;I have pursued social cohesion and reconciliation for several decades &hellip; I have much to say on the matter. But apparently someone higher up in the chain of command doesn&rsquo;t want to hear what I have to say,&rdquo; he said. On hearing about the conference being cancelled, Buthelezi queried the reasons but received no response.&ldquo;I am left with many questions. This conference was postponed once before,&rdquo; he said. The conference was previously set to take place on May 29. Provincial Democratic Alliance leader, Zwakele Mncwango, revealed that the conference was due to cost more than R2 million, including R740 000 to rent Durban&rsquo;s Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre.Social cohesion conference cancelled today was budgeted R2.1 million, another wasteful expenditure by @MYANC .
