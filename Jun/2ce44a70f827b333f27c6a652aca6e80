It&rsquo;s become known as the #WitsCivilSaga.A Wits senior lecturer has sent an open letter to students in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering this week, expressing concerns over the department&rsquo;s assessment criteria. Doctor Precious Biyela, a senior lecturer at the school, sent out an email titled Betting It All! to undergraduate students in the school.In it, she addressed discontentment with regards to the assessment of the course, introduction to environmental engineering for the 2016 academic year.The bone of contention was the granting of a special examination to 19 students for the introduction to environmental engineering to be written on Friday.Biyela explained that these students had previously sat for a supplementary examination on January 6 subsequent to them having failed last year&rsquo;s end of year examination in this course. Deputy vice-chancellor academic, Professor Andrew Crouch, said the reason for providing this special examination was that &ldquo;during the investigation undertaken by the dean of the faculty of engineering and the built environment and I, we discovered that the examination papers for the course were not externally moderated and examined&rdquo;.Biyela rubbished this and argued that &ldquo;no supplementary examinations in the school of environmental engineering were externally assessed in 2016-2017&rdquo;. She did not understand why the introduction to environmental engineering course was the only one singled out for a special examination. According to Biyela &ldquo;the upcoming special examination is only special in that it is fundamentally for the benefit of one student&rdquo;.In her open letter, Biyela referred to a Student X who, according to her, strong-armed the heads of departments into granting this special examination. She detailed a meeting she had with the dean, Ian Jandrell, and Crouch on May 23.In this particular meeting, in which Biyela was accompanied by three representatives from her union, Crouch informed them that he was busy reviewing the assessment of Student X in introduction to environmental engineering and also told them how the student was allowed by his office to register for two courses on the same &ldquo;diagonal&rdquo;, something that is unusual within the institution. Wits student representative council president Kefentse Mkhari said: &ldquo;This open letter contains disheartening issues facing our institution.&rdquo; Mkhari questioned how the university could bend over backwards for one student, adding that &ldquo;because this student is privileged enough to afford legal representation he/she is afforded preferential treatment. "Some students who can afford legal actions fail to even get their marks reviewed but this student gets an entire special examination after having failed.&rdquo; Crouch, however, explained that: &ldquo;This decision applied to all students regardless of their race, gender, class, culture, religion or other affiliations and it is unfortunate that some people are now deliberately racialising this matter, in order to create divisions within the school&rdquo;.Biyela said she was aware of the ramifications but she could not live without disclosing such unfair treatment in the university because it might be happening in other departments.Wits student representative council&rsquo;s academic officer, Zamayirha Peter, said that since Biyela&rsquo;s open letter, her office had received numerous emails from students saying this was also happening in their faculty. Peter mentioned that this included the school of law and the faculty of health science.
