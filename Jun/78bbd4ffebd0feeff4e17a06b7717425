Back in 2015 the Gupta family members were granted early naturalisation by then home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba after not meeting the requirements to be granted South African citizenship. After being mentioned in state capture reports, Gigaba came under scrutiny and so has his decision to provide citizenship to the Guptas. The Guptas have been in the spotlight for their relationship with President Jacob Zuma and allegations of state capture.Leaked documents show how Gigaba may have waived a certain legal requirement to grant the Guptas citizenship by naturalisation.Gigaba maintains that granting this early naturalisation was due to exceptional circumstances.

Home affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni was due to answer questions about the issue this morning but had to cancel because he was needed elsewhere in Parliament.Loading...
