@TimspiritMolobi Cape Town City captain Lebogang Manyama says life will go on without coach Eric Tinkler. Manyama said he was not surprised by Tinkler’s move to SuperSport United because he was one of the best in the country. The striker, who was in Nigeria on national duty with Bafana Bafana, said he learnt through social media of his coach’s departure. “We meet to part and nothing lasts forever ... He must enjoy it. Hopefully we will meet again,” said Manyama. He said Tinkler saw the opportunity and the team had to respect his decision. “We will always cherish the times we spent with him. “I haven’t spoken to him but if a team like SuperSport comes calling you go. You have a family to think about and other things. We are grateful what he has done for us.” He said he had no doubt that Tinkler would make the grade at United, despite his limited coaching experience. “Look at [Zinedine] Zidane [current manager of Real Madrid]. He had no experience but has already proven himself. Eric has been around and I don’t doubt his abilities. Let’s wait and see what he can do.” Tinkler’s departure also raises questions about Manyama’s future at City but the 26-year-old striker said he was still happy in Cape Town. He has been linked with a move to Mamelodi Sundowns. “We will see what happens next but I am happy there. If nothing happens I am still happy to play for Cape Town City.” The Absa Premiership’s top goal scorer, with 13 goals, was hopeful about next season, particularly after finishing third on the log. He said they would have to move on quickly from Tinkler’s departure and help whoever comes as a new coach to improve the team next season.
