She wanted Absa, which bought the bank in the 1990s, to pay back the money. The bank has disagreed with this finding. She ordered remedial action directing Parliament to effect a constitutional amendment to the Reserve Bank&rsquo;s powers.&ldquo;This had an immediate and negative impact on the markets and the exchange rate of the rand,&rdquo; the bank said.The rand slid by about 1.5%, breaching R13 to the dollar on Monday.&ldquo;The amendment would, if effected, strip the Reserve Bank of its key competency to protect the value of the currency and the well understood role that central banks play in securing price stability. "The remedial action proposed will have a negative impact on the independence of the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank acts in terms of its constitutional mandate in the interests of the welfare of all South Africans.&rdquo;READ: Nhlanhla Nene defends Reserve Bank as a shining star in SA
