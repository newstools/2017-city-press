The Gauteng health department has had to call for reinforcements to assist with the backlog at provincial mortuaries due to a strike by forensic pathology officers.The department has formed a team from the South African National Defence Force&rsquo;s health services, said Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa.The pathology officers downed tools last week over salaries and poor working conditions.Several distressed families in Gauteng raised concerns over delays in the release of postmortem results of their loved ones at government mortuaries.Last week, a group of protesters blocked roads near the Diepkloof mortuary in Soweto, demanding the release of the bodies of their family members.Democratic Alliance (DA) health spokesperson Jack Bloom said on Tuesday that the mortuary was the worst affected.&ldquo;Families are suffering extreme distress by the delay in releasing the bodies of their loved ones for burial. Diepkloof mortuary is the worst affected,&rdquo; he said.Bodies are piling up because of strike in Gauteng mortuaries causing great distress to families. It must be resolved urgently!Bloom added that violent scenes erupted there last Friday, with some doctors held hostage for a period of time. I agree, the Department should get a court order like they did last time and enforce it https://t.co/BgQtMliqlI&ldquo;Speedy efforts should be made to address genuine grievances by forensic pathology officers, but any violence should be condemned and halted,&rdquo; Bloom said. Ramokgopa said her department is trying to resolve the matter as soon as possible.She said she visited the Diepkloof mortuary on Friday to try and come up solutions to end the strike, but the talks seem to have reached a deadlock.&ldquo;We have issued a communique yesterday indicating the challenges. There are about 200 post-mortems that are due.&rdquo;The department issued a statement on Tuesday morning urging the officers to return to work.MEDIA STATEMENT: Gauteng Department of Health implores Forensic Pathology Officers to resume services to the public pic.twitter.com/vGO6zvByGR&ldquo;We cannot have a situation where bodies pile up in mortuaries, causing further anguish to bereaved families,&rdquo; Bloom added.
