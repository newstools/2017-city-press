This article has been revised since it was first published. In the original article we omitted to reflect the North West Transport Investment&rsquo;s comment on Mr Maponya&rsquo;s dismissal from the previous board. We apologise for the omission. A man implicated in a damning forensic investigation report for selling a North West government-owned private jet at a &ldquo;loss&rdquo; &ndash; and who was subsequently fired together with the entire board &ndash; is now back working for the province and entrusted with assessing the province&rsquo;s plan to purchase another aircraft.&nbsp;The name of attorney and property tycoon, Phatudi Maponya, was cited in the 2013 forensic report commissioned by the province&rsquo;s public works, roads and transport department as the person who sold the state-owned aircraft in what has further been described as a &ldquo;forced disposal procurement process [in which] procedures were not followed&rdquo;.&nbsp;The aircraft was owned by NorthWest Transport Investment (NTI), which is a public transport entity solely owned by the provincial government. Maponya was at the time the chairperson of the NTI board before it was dissolved by then premier Thandi Modise months before the report was released in September 2013.&nbsp; The forensic report by Mochabapula Consulting Services said the aircraft &ldquo;valued at R9&thinsp;million and the hanger valued at R1.7&thinsp;million were sold by the chairman [Maponya] to one Mister Meyer, thus realising a loss of R4.2&thinsp;million&rdquo;. The allegation formed part of the police&rsquo;s serious economic offences unit investigation in 2014; however, the Hawks this week did not respond to a request for a status update.&nbsp; In a telephonic interview with City Press, Maponya described the forensic report as &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; and threatened to &ldquo;sue&rdquo; any media house or journalist who ran stories based on the report.&nbsp; In a later strongly worded written response on behalf of the NTI, he revealed that Mochabapula was paid more than R8&thinsp;million to produce the report, which he said was &ldquo;riddled with fictitious allegations and findings that cannot be proven in any way whatsoever&rdquo;.&nbsp; He said that the report &ldquo;should not be relied on as it was concocted to tarnish the image of certain individuals&rdquo;, including himself, and that Modise was behind the campaign during her tenure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mochabapula possesses no capacity, expertise or proficiency to conduct a forensic investigation. Of importance, Mochabapula possesses no credibility to act truthfully or honestly... [the company] is nothing but a dishonourable entity that was appointed to carry out &lsquo;forensic&rsquo; investigations for ulterior motives and to provide findings without substance or facts,&rdquo; Maponya wrote.&nbsp; He added that this was &ldquo;the main reason, according to us, why the law enforcement agencies can also not act or make any logical determination based on this unsubstantiated report&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mochabapula is nothing but an entity employed by former dismissed employees of the department and the NTI to drain off state monies under the guise of a forensic investigation. [The company] has charged both the department and the NTI exorbitant monies for work not done or simply grossly inflated,&rdquo; the NTI board chairperson added.&nbsp; He also said he was never afforded the opportunity to give his side of the story by Mochabapula in its investigation. Mochabapula found that the aircraft was sold at a loss, but Maponya said the sale was &ldquo;above board and that there was a tender process&rdquo;.&nbsp;Former North West public works, roads and transport MEC Raymond Elisha told City Press that, &ldquo;to the best of my knowledge, neither Modise nor myself carried any knowledge of the sale of the aircraft until during the forensic investigation conducted by [an advocate] and reviewed by Mochabapula, since there was a concurrent investigation in the department&rdquo;.&nbsp; Elisha said the investigation revealed &ldquo;massive infidelity&rdquo; on the part of the NTI. The provincial government, as 100% shareholder of the NTI, &ldquo;convened in a special shareholder&rsquo;s meeting, dismissed the board headed by Maponya and even preferred charges against the then CEO, Tshepiso Letselela&rdquo;.&nbsp; When Premier Supra Mahumapelo came into office in 2014, he reinstated Maponya and others. The current board of the NTI told City Press that Maponya took his dismissal by Modise to the CCMA and labour court and won his case.&nbsp; &ldquo;He took government to court because they alleged wrongdoing and they had the opportunity to prove all wrong doing on his part and they failed as he had not done anything wrong&rdquo; the NTI said on his behalf. &nbsp; Elisha said the CEO of Mochabapula, Johannes Mohlabine, was a former SA Revenue Service (Sars) employee and had extensive investigative experience and impeccable qualifications. &ldquo;The product of his investigation was shared with the Priority Crimes Unit of the SA Police Service (SAPS). He also offered to testify in court should any of the matters be prosecuted. Attached to all his reports was a portfolio of evidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said Mohlabine&rsquo;s record in forensic auditing included conducting the arms deal investigation on behalf of SizweNtsalubaGobodo. &ldquo;At Sars he was in forensic auditing doing high-profile cases and he worked at the JSE as a surveillance officer responsible for investigations,&rdquo; said Elisha.&nbsp; He said Mohlabine was a member of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (SA chapter), a member of the Institute of Business Accountants and he had served articles with KPMG both in Cape Town and Johannesburg.&nbsp; He said among his qualifications were a master&rsquo;s in international and domestic tax law, a Bachelor of Commerce degree, diploma in corporate law, diploma in criminal investigation and forensic auditing and a higher diploma in international tax law.&nbsp; Mohlabine said his company had no doubts about their findings. He said the report had exhibit files attached to the back of each finding.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our findings are with the Hawks and they have been calling me for any clarity and they are happy with our report. I understand that the Hawks have now passed the matter on to the National Prosecuting Authority,&rdquo; Mohlabine said, adding that he considered the matter sub judice and would not want to discuss deeper details of the report.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the North West government has commissioned the NTI to do a &ldquo;cost-benefit analysis&rdquo; that will assist in the decision-making on whether the administration could purchase an aircraft and it was awaiting feedback.&nbsp; However, Maponya said in his written response that &ldquo;there is nothing wrong in procuring an aircraft that is meant to serve the entire nation as opposed to the six-seater aircraft that was 35 years old&rdquo;.&nbsp; The idea of buying an aircraft triggered objection in the province, sending the provincial administration into a huge public relations exercise to refute reports that a &ldquo;private jet&rdquo; was going to be used exclusively by Mahumapelo and his executive.&nbsp; Government spokesperson Brian Setswambung said &ldquo;should the outcome of the cost-benefit analysis reveal that it will be cheaper to buy our own aircraft, [government] will, through the NTI, purchase such and it will be for commercial use&rdquo;.&nbsp; DA provincial leader Joe McGluwa said commercial airline business should be left to relevant people and not government. McGluwa said the DA would challenge Mahumapelo&rsquo;s administration to act on the findings of the forensic report done by Mochabapula.&nbsp; Economic Freedom Fighters member of the provincial legislature, Alfred Motsi, said Maponya was fired and suddenly joined the same company in the same capacity under Mahumapelo.
