This festive period saw a spike in the number of people drowning, up dramatically from last year. The National Sea Rescue Institute recorded a total of 37 drownings between December 1 and January 2 this year. “Thirty-seven fatal drownings (23 adults and 14 children) were attended to around the coast and on inland waters,” the institute said. The majority of the drownings happened in the sea, suspected to be caused by coastal rip-currents, but some were from suspected medical causes. The charity said it responded to 132 distress calls in which 193 people were rescued and 10 animals were assisted. “In 38 of these operations we responded to boats and ships calling for assistance and we evacuated three patients for medical reasons from ships. Ten animals were also assisted,” said the institute. The institute said that the number of fatal drowning accidents increased from the same period last year. The SABC reported that from December 2015 to January 2016 there were 22 drownings – 14 adult incidents and 8 children incidents. Over the 2015-2016 festive season the institute rescued a total of 141 people in 123 cases. “We suspect that this may be due to an increase in the number of people visiting beaches and inland waters this holiday season.” It is also not clear which fatalities were due to alcohol consumption, but the charity has cautioned against the use of alcohol near water. “We encourage the public not to drink alcohol around water and we urge parents to make sure that children have responsible adult supervision around water and that your swimming pool at home has a cloak of safety around it.” Bathers have also been cautioned about the full moon spring tide which poses a potential hazard. “As we approach the full moon spring tide, which peaks on January 12, we will again be sending out warnings of the increased risks from stronger rip currents from January 8 onwards,” warned the institute.
