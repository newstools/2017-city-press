It has been 19 days since photographer Shiraaz Mohamed was kidnapped in Syria while on assignment with South African charity Gift of the Givers.These exclusive pictures are the last he filed before he was abducted in the war-torn country.Mohamed&rsquo;s pictures were taken in a refugee camp in Darkush close to the Turkish border, about 100km southwest of Aleppo.In his emails to City Press pictures editor Dudu Mathebula, Mohamed, from Cape Town, writes: &ldquo;I should be back in Johannesburg, God willing, in the next few days and then I [will] sort out all of my pics and videos.&ldquo;This is a personal project for me and I have plans to travel to Jordan, Morocco and Greece over the next eight months. &ldquo;I feel that it is the least that I can do for the Syrians. Hence the reason for me not charging [any money for the photographs to be published].&rdquo;It appears from the email exchange that followed, specifically an email sent on January 10, a day before he went missing, that Mohamed knew there was a risk he would be abducted.&ldquo;I will travel back to Turkey today using unconventional methods so I do risk detention,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Give me a few days if I am not detained.&rdquo;He didn&rsquo;t make it out.In a statement released on Monday, Gift of the Givers said it had received &ldquo;credible&rdquo; information that Mohamed was still alive and that it had found Mohamed&rsquo;s belongings, including his camera.His family said it was a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo;.His former wife, Shaaziya Brijlal, told Eyewitness News that she and the rest of the family were relieved at the reports.&ldquo;Thank God that our prayers have been heard and answered, it&rsquo;s like a light at the end of this really horrible, long tunnel that we were all stuck in,&rdquo; she reportedly said. &ldquo;I am in such a good mood ... The support has been incredible. &ldquo;He deserves this, he is such a good guy.&rdquo;Pictures by&nbsp;Shiraaz Mohamed&nbsp;
