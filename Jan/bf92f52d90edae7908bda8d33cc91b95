Thirteen of 39 Mpumalanga’s independent schools will face the wrath of MEC Reginah Mhaule for their poor results. Mhaule said while announcing the province’s Grade 12 results in Marapyane near Siyabuswa that these schools had performed below the provincial pass rate of 77.1%. These schools face being de-registered or their subsidies suspended. “It is concerning that there are 13 independent schools that have performed below the provincial pass rate. The department will not hesitate to implement its policies with regards to subsidies and de-registration”, Mhaule said. Of all the independent schools only five obtained a 100% pass rate. The province enrolled 60 794 candidates for the 2016 exams. These included 14 027 learners who failed Grade 12 but were progressed. Mhaule said the progressed pupils affected the overall pass rate, which without them, would have been 81.3%. However, 54% of the progressed pupils did pass. The province’s highlights for the matric results were: » Hoërskool Nelspruit is the top performing school. All 229 learners passed and 78% qualified to study for Bachelor degrees; » The most improved school is Mehlwana Secondary School in Emalahleni. The school’s 72 candidates ratcheted up their performance by 56% from 2015. Their overall pass rate was 94.4%; » The number of schools that achieved a 100% rate increased from 12 to 22. The province had 549 schools registered for the exams; » 261 of the 549 schools achieved a pass rate between 80% and 99%; » Mashishing circuit in Bohlabela is the most improved of the 68 circuits with a 94.6% pass rate. This is an improvement of 4.1% from the 2015 results; » Seven pupils scored 100% in physical science while four achieved the same score in accounting. Mhaule said that she was proud that the province has consistently delivered “credible and incident-free” examinations since 2010.
