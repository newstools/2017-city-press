The matter ended up being provisionally withdrawn. The State also requested some witness statements to be obtained. This case will be reinstated once the investigation has been finalised.&rdquo;Ntabazalila said the case of assault and intimidation were related. &ldquo;It is alleged that the accused assaulted the complainant and the complainant went to hospital. The accused then went to the hospital where he threatened the mother of the complainant. The mother opened a case of intimidation. Both cases will be re-enrolled once the investigation is finalised,&rdquo; Ntabazalila said.The spokesperson had not responded to questions on whether Mohamed was indeed out on bail and the bail conditions in light of last year&rsquo;s assault on the homeless man.Without going into details because the matter was still sub judice, Kinnear confirmed the incident saying he entered into a settlement with Mohamed following a claim for damages.&ldquo;He has never paid,&rdquo; said Kinnear.He said Mohamed agreed to fork out R351 809 with 9% interest a year in May last year.Mohamed was required to pay an initial amount of at least R10 000 by June last year.The sheriff went to write up his belongings in the house and restaurant to recover the costs, Kinnear said, adding that his criminal case was still with prosecutors and Mohamed was out on bail of R500, granted shortly after he opened the case in 2015.According to a medical report compiled by Dr Burnet Meyer, who performed a clinical evaluation on Kinnear as a result of the alleged assault, Kinnear suffered &ldquo;blunt trauma to his right eye socket&rdquo;.Meyer recorded that Kinnear also sustained:&raquo; Two lacerations on his right upper eyelid; and&raquo; Globe perforation of 8mm in length and 6mm from superior limbus.During a follow-up check-up, Meyer picked up that Kinnear had suffered vitreous haemorrhage and early traumatic cataract.Meyer observed that the cataract would need to be surgically removed and replaced with a lens implant.Peripheral retinal laser treatment was needed to stabilise perforation, Meyer observed.&ldquo;No contact sport allowed anymore &hellip; He is very fortunate not to have lost his eye in this incident,&rdquo; Meyer stated in his report.Mort said she was in the dark about her case.She said the investigating officer had indicated that the matter was with the senior public prosecutors.
