Of bears and beauties, ogres and magic: the People’s Theatre has it all for 2017. Under the artistic direction of Keith Smith and Jill Gerard, this fabulous little theatre situated in the Joburg Theatre precinct has a fabulous line-up for the whole family. Winnie the Pooh Kicking off with the all-time favourite Winnie the Pooh in March/April, the theatre presents a group of stories that speak of friends, food, birthday parties, honey, tree houses and laughter – in fact, everything a young child can dream of. AA Milne’s lovable bear character turns 91 next year and he isn’t a classic for no reason. Cinderella Kids The June/July holiday season stages Disney’s Cinderella Kids, which sees Brothers Grimm meeting the magic of Disney. With a bibbity-bobbity-boo, you will get to see how rags can become riches and sympathetic mice, handsome carriage drivers. But more than that, you can get to see how dreams really can come true. To be announced The September holidays features an educational theatre programme: details will be announced closer to the time. Shrek The year will be brought to overwhelming closure with Shrek the Musical, back by popular demand. It’s the tale of a homely green ogre with a heart of gold and an eye on land restitution when it comes to his precious swamp. It features a talking donkey, a puss in boots, and is a production that has really brought audiences back for more, time and again. The opportunity of watching live theatre is something that will touch your child’s heart and mind forever. It will open his or her awareness to a whole world that can be constructed in a time span of 90 minutes, and the thrill and drama of rough and tumble chases through the auditorium, song and dance and the beauty of storytelling is a gift that will carry on giving, always. » Special prices are available for group bookings and if you’re a member of the theatre’s kids’ club, you will get discounted tickets. Free secure parking is accessible in the theatre complex.
