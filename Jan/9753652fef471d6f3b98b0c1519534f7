The people of South Africa are correct to expect the leadership of the ANC to lead by example and from the front, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe told about 300 party members and supporters during a public meeting on Wednesday in Bekkersdal, western Gauteng. Mantashe said the ANC’s 105th birthday celebrations this weekend coincided with the celebration of 100 years since the birth of the longest-serving ANC president, the late Oliver Tambo, who “represented ethics and revolutionary morality”. He said revolutionary morality meant that leaders must conduct themselves in an exemplary way in public and avoid doing things that brought the ANC into disrepute because “their job is to display ethics and morality”. “ANC revolutionaries must be held to a higher standard. We cannot compare ourselves to the apartheid regime or the DA or the EFF,” said Mantashe, who was on a campaign to garner support for the ANC as it hosts the 105th birthday rally at Orlando stadium in Soweto on Sunday. He was accompanied by State Security Minister David Mahlobo; Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana; Gauteng Finance MEC Barbara Creecy; and ANC Mpumalanga deputy chairperson Violet Siwela. Television star Don Mlangeni-Nawa took to the stage to support the ANC and urged residents to attend the weekend rally before lining up for selfies with fans.
