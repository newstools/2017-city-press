Democratic Alliance Leader Mmusi Maimane will request that the Independent Electoral Commission investigates &ldquo;possible violations of the Electoral Act&rdquo;, when he meets with the body in the coming weeks, he said today. This comes after it was revealed that the ANC had engaged in a &ldquo;paid twitter&rdquo; campaign to discredit the DA and the Economic Freedom Fighters during the local government elections last year. &ldquo;The fraudulent propaganda campaign by the ANC, must be treated with contempt by all South Africans who believe in the sanctity of the Constitution and the democratic values it espouses,&rdquo; Maimane said. After the ANC planned to spend a whopping R50 million on the covert &ldquo;black-ops&rdquo; operation as reported by the Amabhungane Centre of Investigative Journalism, a covert team known as the War Room was put together. It included public relations expert Sihle Bolani, who claims she is owed R2.2 million for work done as part of the campaign. The team was later known as the &ldquo;Media Advisory Team&rdquo; and was to be led by Shaka Sisulu, grandson of struggle icon Walter Sisulu. Today Sisulu released a statement denying these allegations. He said the reports were &ldquo;inherently false, exaggerated and no doubt intended to discredit in part my reputation, and most significantly the name of the African National Congress&rdquo;. He added that he was unapologetic for his contributions towards the ANC.
