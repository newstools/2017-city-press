A &ldquo;total shut down of schools&rdquo; is expected to occur in Limpopo tomorrow, as the Congress of South African Trade Unions plans protest action in the province. This comes after the union expressed its frustrations at the education department&rsquo;s careless attitude towards addressing glaring issues that remain unresolved, including:&raquo; Delivery of textbooks and stationery to all deserving schools;&raquo; Payment of salaries to all educators not paid some since April 2016;&raquo; Payment of all outstanding allowances and benefits owed to teachers and school principals such as acting allowance for school principals; and&raquo; Proper infrastructure and maintenance development plans for schools.&ldquo;The union will no longer tolerate the inexcusable continual explanations as the department tries to justify their continual failures. "The South African Democratic Teachers&rsquo; Union has resolved to take to the streets of Polokwane to pressurise the department to resolve the challenges with immediate effect least they face the reality of total shutdown of schools and departmental offices until the following issues are resolved,&rdquo; Cosatu said earlier today. According to spokespersoj &nbsp;Sowell Tjabane, between 5000 and 10 000 people are expected to engage in the protest, including teachers. &ldquo;It will be a one-day activity where the South African Democratic Teacher&rsquo;s Union together with Nehawu will be handing over a memorandum of demands to the department of education, treasury and the office of the premier."Schools in Limpopo will be shut down for the day,&rdquo; Tjabane told City Press. The department of education will have 21 days to respond to the demands. The education department had not commented by the time of publication.
