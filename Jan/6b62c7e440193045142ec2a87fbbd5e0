A group made up of individual members of youth structures such as the ANC Youth League and the Young Communist League is actively drumming up support for deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to become the next ANC president. In a document titled CR-17 New National Road Towards ANC Leadership, which was distributed to the media for publication, the group clarifies its support for Ramaphosa.The rest of the Top Six leadership are Dr Zweli Mkhize (deputy president), David Makhura (secretary-general), Vuyiswa Tulelo (deputy secretary-general), Enoch Godongwana (treasurer) and Thandi Modise (national chairperson). The document features the same top six as the anonymous list that was distributed by The New Age a few weeks ago.Khusela Sangoni, the ANC&rsquo;s national communications manager, said that she could not comment on a document that had no status in the party. &ldquo;I also want to reiterate the position of the National Working Committee that members and structures should cease to disclose names of their preferred candidates because it is divisive. The ANC will, at the right time, issue guidelines on how members can motivate for their candidates,&rdquo; she said.The ANC is electing new leaders in December.Nkosiyabo Mnguni, a member of the ANC Youth League and the Young Communist League in Mpumalanga, who calls himself the national mobiliser of CR-17, wrote in the document that they were supporting the sort of leadership that would be able to restore the image of the ANC. &ldquo;The ANC should rebuild its political strength and revive its character and integrity for the masses of South Africa by re-occupying its political position to win the confidence of the people through electing leadership with the capability to restore the image of the ANC.&ldquo;The ANC needs credible leadership with revolutionary morality, integrity and to continue [to give] hope to the people of South Africa and be inspirational. We have learnt a lot from the generation of Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and [Oliver] Tambo, on what type of leaders the ANC should have.&ldquo;In my own political observations, there are still leaders with revolutionary morality; long-serving comrades who can take South Africa forward and not compromise our developmental objectives,&rdquo; said the document.Mnguni claimed that the group consisted of &ldquo;thousands&rdquo; of members but confirmed that they didn&rsquo;t represent formal structures.&ldquo;We just felt that we wanted to clarify why we support Comrade Ramaphosa,&rdquo; he said.This came after the national working committee members and structures were asked to refrain from prematurely revealing their preferred candidates for the ANC presidency.Mnguni said he wrote this document before the ANC expressed itself on this. The goal was for ANC members to use it as a guideline for formal discussions.He has received a wide response. &ldquo;Many members reacted angrily because they are being handled politically and are loyal to specific leaders. Other comrades are scared to say too much,&rdquo; he said.
