Mpumalanga human settlements MEC Speedy Mashilo and police have bust a consortium that has been selling fake Reconstruction and Development Programme contracts to companies.Mashilo said that the consortium, which called itself the Bondeiro Business Development Consortium, had lured contractors by claiming that his department had awarded it an RDP contract worth R1.7 billion.Bondeiro also claimed that it had contracts in various government departments in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, North West and Limpopo to:&raquo; Upgrade cemeteries for R3 million and a sports stadium for R30 million at Moretele Local Municipality in Hammanskraal; &raquo; Deliver 10 000 houses in Mpumalanga for R166 800 a unit; &raquo; Build three schools in the North West province at between R95 million and R100 million; and &raquo; Construct a sports centre for R480 million in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. Mashilo said that he became aware of this scam when the consortium targeted a contractor in Mpumalanga and promised to give him 100 of the 10 000 RDP units in the province provided he put down R100 000 upfront.The consortium would charge an additional R6 000 a unit as commission and effectively make R700 000 from the deal, and the contractor would pocket R16 million.The 100 units would cost R16.8 million, according to the consortium&rsquo;s offer. The actual price of an RDP house is R110 000 and 100 units would cost R11 million.&ldquo;They were using my name by telling people that I had awarded them the units. The unscrupulous consortium&rsquo;s modus operandi is very appealing to normal service providers in need of jobs, especially from the government,&rdquo; Mashilo said.&ldquo;We believe that they solicit company names from some database, whether inside or outside government, and target those by selling fake jobs to them.&rdquo;Mashilo said that his department, police and the State Security Agency engaged a company that had been targeted to meet with a representative of the bogus consortium, hand over the R100 000 and enter into a contract. A Bondeiro representative honoured the meeting in Bronkhorstspruit, Gauteng, and that was when police swooped in.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re appealing to all service providers [contractors] to be very vigilant when it comes to bogus tenders awarded by government,&rdquo; Mashilo said.
