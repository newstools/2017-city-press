The last time Danny Jordaan travelled with Bafana Bafana on the continent was back in 1997 for that infamous World Cup qualifier against the Congo in Point Noire. Two decades later, Jordaan still remembers the events of that trip when the team was threatened with guns before a practice session, while the game itself was a bruising battle. He still remembers the famous sight of Mark Fish’s bloody face after sustaining a massive gash on his head. This week the Safa president accompanied Bafana Bafana to Cape Verde for their all-important 2018 World Cup qualifier against the host this evening. Jordaan said he felt it was important to travel with the team and to give them his support. “For me this game carries the same stature and significance to the one in Point Noire. It is that match again that we need to win at all costs to stand a good chance of going to Russia,” said Jordaan. “If we go to Durban with three points, we’ll be in a better position to win the group but it starts here with this one. "With the kind of players we have in the team I’m very optimistic about this one. We must win here and finish the job at home on Tuesday.” The two countries will meet again at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Tuesday evening. He said with next year being Nelson Mandela’s centenary celebrations, qualifying for Russia would be a significant milestone for the team and the country. “Remember this is Madiba’s team. We were the first team in South Africa to play for him on his inauguration in 1994.”
