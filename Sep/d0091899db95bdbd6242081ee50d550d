The decision made by government in October 2015 to freeze fee hikes at universities was a welcome relief that put a stop to the ongoing student protests across the country. The announcement served as a stopgap measure while a long-lasting solution to the students’ demands was being sought. This culminated in the setting up of a commission of inquiry, headed by Judge Jonathan Heher, to determine the feasibility of free higher education. President Jacob Zuma confirmed receiving the report on August 31 and said he would study it before making it public. At this point, maybe we should be thinking about a plan to avert potential disruptions at universities next year. As things stand, key role players – university managers and student activists – have no idea if there will be fee increases next year. Their calls for meetings between Zuma and Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande have fallen on deaf ears. Time is running out. Yesterday marked the 24th day since the president has had the eagerly awaited Heher report. This time last year, there were already indications – following meetings between Nzimande and higher education stakeholders – on what would most likely happen in the next academic year. This year, that is not the case. Student activists are already putting plans in place to counter any announcement that may not satisfy them. While ANC elections are keeping everyone busy this year, the issue of university fees should not be used to score political points. Mr President, you are the only one standing between potential chaos and making a pronouncement on the fees issue that may be embraced by everyone next year. Why the delay?
