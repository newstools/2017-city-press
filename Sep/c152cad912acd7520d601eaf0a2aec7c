A win for Bafana will be good news to lift the country. This was the message from Minister of Sports and Recreation Thulas Nxesi to Bafana Bafana ahead of their 2018 World Cup qualifier against Cape Verde this evening. Nxesi, who accompanied the team to the Atlantic Ocean Island, assured them of the government’s support and urged them to go all out to make the country proud. “This is the good news we need as the government as millions of South Africans – black and white together – will be glued to their screens cheering on the team and they cannot afford to disappoint us. "It is not about them but the country as a whole. They must remember the government and all South Africans are behind them tonight,” said Nxesi. He said he had no doubt that the team would do well after witnessing them at training and their mood ahead of tonight’s game. He said he was impressed with the welcoming they got from the host nation. “Except for the high temperatures here, there are no other challenges. This is a good country and we got a good reception and the people are not hostile.”
