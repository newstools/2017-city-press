SuperSport United goalkeeper Ronwen Williams got the nod ahead of Wayne Sandilands in Bafana goals for tonightâ€™s 2018 World Cup qualifier against Cape Verde. Kick off is at 8.30pm SA time. Bafana coach Stuart Baxter made two forced changes to the team that won away in Nigeria in June, with Williams taking the place of the injured Itumeleng Khune and Lebogang Manyama coming in for Sibusiso Vilakazi, who was not selected. The goalkeeping department was the most debatable position with Sandilands also in the picture but Baxter opted for Williams because of his excellent performance over a long period at his club. Sandilands had just tasted action after his move to Orlando Pirates from Mamelodi Sundowns, where he was not a regular. Thulani Hlatshwayo, who was nursing a hamstring injury, and Riyaad Pieterse are not in the match day team. Overall it is a well-balanced team which is expected to run all over the islanders. The starting XI: Williams, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Thulani Serero, Teboho Langerman, Dean Furman, Bongani Zungu, Keagan Dolly, Themba Zwane, Lebogang Manyama, Tokelo Rantie. Subs: Wayne Sandilands, Morgan Gould, Clayton Daniels, Sifiso Hlanti, Kamohelo Mokotjo, Andile Jali, Hlompho Kekana, Daylon Claasen, Percy Tau, Bradley Grobler, Abubaker Mobara, Kermit Erasmus
