Mamelodi Sundowns have sent defender Mzikayise Mashaba packing. City Press can today reveal that the 28-year-old was advised that his contract would be terminated with immediate effect for misconduct. A high-ranking Sundowns official confirmed that Mashaba was shown the door following a spate of running battles with the club, which include ill-discipline and missing training sessions. “He is gone,” said the source. “The club had had enough of him and decided to issue him with a clearance. It has been a long time coming as he was given too many chances to mend his ways but failed to do so. The coach didn’t want to see him go, but he reluctantly accepted the situation.” Sundowns media liaison officer Thulani Thuswa confirmed the club had parted ways with the player. “The club held a disciplinary inquiry following misconduct by Mashaba on May 10 during our match against Baroka. The player pleaded guilty and he was subsequently dismissed,” said Downs. Mashaba’s agent, Tim Sukazi, confirmed that the player was advised by the club of the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry – the committee chair recommended that his contract be terminated. However, Sukazi said their legal team was looking at the matter and were of the view that “there are procedural and legal issues that need to be addressed, which they are working on now together with Sundowns”. “As a matter of fact, he was never handed a clearance by Sundowns. But of grave concern is the timing of this decision as you are well aware that he is injured and will be laid off for a few months with an Achilles tendon injury,” said Sukazi. The left-footed winger was recently linked with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. Now that he is a free agent, he can join the club of his choice. He was in the books of Platinum Stars, Free State Stars and Bidvest Wits before joining Sundowns in 2013. This move could push Sundowns to intensify their pursuit of Cape Town City winger Aubrey Ngoma.
