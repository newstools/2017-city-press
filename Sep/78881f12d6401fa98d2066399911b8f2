The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal says it has fired eThekwini regional secretary Bheki Ntuli&rsquo;s bodyguards following a &ldquo;disturbing&rdquo; video which circulated on social media on Thursday.The footage shows two men looking into a dashboard camera, brandishing guns and an AK-47, and bragging that they are going to kill someone. After confirming that they had seen the footage, the ANC distanced itself from the incident and said it would investigate the origins of the footage.&ldquo;The African National Congress strongly denounces and distances itself from this irresponsible display of weapons, irrespective of the purpose for which it was done,&rdquo; the party said in a statement.It further called on the security company responsible for the guards &ldquo;to take actions against this unpalatable conduct&rdquo;. The video surfaced amidst investigations of politically-motivated killings which have been on the rise in KwaZulu-Natal. The Democratic Alliance&rsquo;s Dean Macpherson said it was important for the date of the video to be established as it could be useful in linking it to political killings that have taken place.During a media briefing hours before the video emerged, KZN secretary Super Zuma said that the political killings were not necessarily a result of battles within the ruling party, but that a &ldquo;sponsored&rdquo; third force could be behind them.&ldquo;We are of the view that there seems to be deeper things we are not dealing with. &ldquo;In the late 80s and 90s, we all thought it was black-on-black violence and we were focusing on dealing with that.&ldquo;Later on, we learnt that it was sponsored violence through the apartheid government. &ldquo;Looking at the manner in which things were done at that time, we are saying let&rsquo;s broaden our thinking and not just leave it here with the ANC.&ldquo;The pattern in which it is happening is not violence, it is assassinations. They are being committed by well-trained people,&rdquo; Zuma said.
