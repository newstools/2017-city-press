The tax ombud, Judge Bernard Ngoepe, has found that the South African Revenue Service has more than 10 instances of systemic flaws that have contributed to taxpayers&rsquo; refunds being unduly delayed.The office of the tax ombud today released its report following an investigation into allegations that Sars was using a number of tactics to delay refunding taxpayers and it found that in at least 10 instances, Sars systems were found wanting.According to the report, which was instituted earlier this year, Sars has, among other things, failed to link submitted requested documents to taxpayers&rsquo; main files, allegedly used the filing of new returns as an excuse to block refunds, imposed a number of special stoppers in their system allegedly to prevent fraud but delayed in lifting them, used historic returns to delay the payment of refunds, raised assessments and pass journals to clear unallocated credits as well as raising of assessments prematurely.Ngoepe also recommended that where an auditor failed to ask for all documents at once, and the refund was consequently delayed, Sars should pay interest on the delayed refund.This came after complaints that Sars auditors kept audits pending while repeatedly requesting information from taxpayers.&ldquo;Apart from delaying the refund, the incidental consequence is that if successive requests for information are sent out, each within 21 days of the other, interest will not start accruing on the refund,&rdquo; the report said.The 81-page report also sets out the recommendations of the ombud on each of the issues, and it was after the office received complaints by taxpayers that Sars employed certain mechanisms to unduly delay, or even avoid, paying out refunds due to them.&ldquo;Taxpayers have over the years been complaining that Sars unduly delays the payment of verified refunds. The complaints reached their peak in the period December 2016 to March 2017. Taxpayers identified certain mechanisms allegedly employed by Sars, in the implementation of the tax collections system, to cause the delay. &ldquo;The ultimate wish by the taxpayers is that these mechanisms be eliminated from of the system; otherwise, be implemented in a manner that would cause the least possible delay in the payment of the refunds.&rdquo; Ngoepe said in the report.
