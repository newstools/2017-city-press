Isidingo celebrated its 19th birthday at an intimate dinner with cast, crew and friends of the show last week. But strangely, only a handful of the cast and crew were in attendance. No Barker Haines, and no Georgie Zamdela! How are we celebrating Isidingo without Robert Whitehead and Darlington Michaels? It was all rather puzzling. We’re in a place called Back of the Moon in Gold Reef City – remember Sonny Jacobs owned it in the original Generations? This restaurant’s décor looks a little like the old Rec Club before the Isidingo writers made that establishment black-owned. A table away, Kuli Roberts and Nina Hastie call to their friend Khabonina Qubeka to join them and embark on what could only be described as an impromptu selfie photoshoot which made sitting behind them rather awkward, even though all three of these stars looked stunning. The food was scrumptious. Shrimp cocktails, kudu loin steaks and an array of sweet treats for dessert, which provided some much-needed relief from the evening’s entertainment. MC Soso Rungqu (Morongwa) expressed joy and gratitude on behalf of the cast: “We all love being on Isidingo, ask any of us.” Motlatsi Mafatshe (Sechaba Moloi) charmed the room and encouraged everyone to loosen up. Cast members Makgotso M, Pelo Mohale, Matlala, Amos Ketlele as well as friends of the show Karin Van der Laag, who is now a judge on a reality show, The Final Cut, were mingling with the crowd. Sinazo Yolwa ran around doing her Real Goboza thing as executive producer Pumla Hopa thanked everybody involved. They showed a teaser of what we can expect in the weeks to come on Isidingo. Think Game of Thrones, the Red Wedding meets Marikana. After this the night took a left turn with the introduction of a duo of cabaret singers, who naturally did covers. I wondered whether they could not afford a Vusi Nova or something. Alas, the evening ended and Barker didn’t emerge, nor did Katlego Danke, Shannon Esra and Linda Sokhulu.
