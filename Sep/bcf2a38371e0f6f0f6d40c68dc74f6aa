Bafana Bafana will go for an all-out attack against Cape Verde this evening because they want to get their 2018 Fifa World Cup dream back on track. Following their shock 2-1 defeat by the same country on Friday, Bafana know that only a victory at Moses Mabhida will keep their hopes alive. Kick-off is at 7pm. Coach Stuart Baxter said he hoped his pep talk would go a long way in motivating the players, and he expected a positive response after their shocking display in Praia on Friday. “We have done what we had to do and I hope they will respond big time. They all know what is at stake and hopefully they will do justice in the game,” said Baxter. He expected the visitors to deploy a cautious approach to the game and try to catch Bafana on counter attacks. “They know we will come at them but that doesn’t mean we will be reckless in our approach. I hope we unsettle them early on so we disrupt their plans. From what I have seen at training the players are buzzing and ready to go and this is the kind of attitude we needed in Praia. “We could not have asked for a better time to respond and get our acts together and I am confident we will do the country proud.” He said the goalless draw between Senegal and Burkina Faso worked in their favour as the point gap between the countries is minimal. Burkina Faso go into tonight’s clash against the same Senegal leading the group on five points with both the Lions of Teranga (Senegal) and Bafana on four points each while the islanders have three.
