Cape Verde coach Lucio Antunes is targeting six points from Bafana Bafana to revive their chances of qualifying for next year’s Fifa World Cup in Russia. Antunes said they were in South Africa for one thing – and one thing only – three more points. The Blue Sharks already have three points in the bag after beating Bafana at home on Friday and Antunes was confident ahead of this evening’s clash. He said they have nothing to lose and pressure would be on Bafana to get the results at home. “We have shown that we can beat them and this is what we are here for,” said Antunes at the Moses Mabhida Stadium before their final training session. “We have lots of respect for South Africa but we also have ambitions of going to the World Cup. You can imagine what that would mean to our country – with the smallest population of half a million people.” Although he regards Bafana as the favourite in the group he says their aim is to take is down to the wire and still be in the running when the final round of fixtures is played in November. “The win has given us a boost and we believe we have equal chance of making it but we will take one game at the time.”
