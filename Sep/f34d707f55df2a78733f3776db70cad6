To be celebrated as a living legend is one of the greatest honours to be bestowed upon an artist. And at the age of 78, jazz trumpeter Hugh Masekela is on the go-go-go. Late last week we learnt that he had to postpone a planned collaboration with rapper Riky Rick for eye surgery. The collaboration was part of a project for the 20th addition of the Standard Bank Joy of Jazz Music Festival. But fans need not be dismayed – the legend will perform at the annual DStv iRock Limpopo Music Festival taking place at Polokwane Cricket Club on Saturday. Recently honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice Awards, Bra Hugh expressed how humbling it was to receive awards for his career, which has spanned more than 50 years. Although, he said, he didn’t put too much sentimental value on the awards received but rather perceived them as a token of appreciation from audiences who enjoy his music. The respected, well-renowned musician lamented that the South African music culture was stagnant, saying that South Africa lacked the public safety that would accommodate artistry in its purist form. His response was quite light-hearted over the phone when asked who he felt deserved more recognition for prestigious awards; saying that he was not a recognition official but his personal favourite musicians were the likes of Thandiswa Mazwai, Cameron Ward and Zonke. Bra Hugh said that he was in a place in his career where he had to give his fans what they wanted. He will doing just that when headlining the DStv iRock Music Festival. His advice to the upcoming artists who could be performing on the #DStvIRock stage is: “Gimmicks won’t work. You have to work on your craft”. This year’s DStv iRock festival will be one of the greatest stories told in comedy, song and dance. Don’t miss the most explosive four days of your life in the heart of Limpopo this heritage weekend.
