Opposition parties accused the health minister of not learning anything from the tragic deaths of more than 100 psychiatric patients in what has become known as the &ldquo;Esidimeni tragedy&rdquo;.This after Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, in an answer to a Parliamentary question, acknowledged that he was aware of at least 26 state psychiatric patients who were being treated in prisons in the Northern Cape because there were not enough facilities.Motsoaledi said he was informed by the minister of justice of the situation in September last year and the issue was discussed with MEC for health&ldquo;The requirements and plans for each province including the Northern Cape to alleviate the current challenges were agreed to, including prioritising building of new facilities where required or adding additional wards in already existing State facilities. &ldquo;The national health council even agreed on the additions needed in each province with the help of the mental health unit in the national department of health. It is now up to the provinces to start budgeting and commissioning the constructions as this falls within their purview,&rdquo; Motsoaledi said.But Inkatha Freedom Party member of Parliament Liezel van der Merwe was having none of it.&ldquo;Under no circumstances is it acceptable for mentally ill patients to be confined to the harsh environments of our correctional centres. Mentally ill South Africans are in need of special care and protection. Confining them to prisons will only serve to aggravate their conditions.&rdquo;Van der Merwe accused Motsoaledi and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini of negligence, and said they should be held accountable for the violation of the rights of these psychiatric patients.&ldquo;The IFP is of the view that a full audit must be conducted with regard to the state of the provision of mental healthcare services in South Africa by Government, in order to avoid yet another Esidimeni tragedy,&rdquo; she said.About 100 psychiatric patients died after the Gauteng health department transferred them from the Esidimeni Life hospital to various, unlicensed non-governmental organisations in a bid to save money.The Democratic Alliance indicated that it would ask the health ombud to investigate the living conditions of the 26 patients.DA MP Karen Jooste said in a statement that the party had reason to believe that Motsoaledi was aware of the situation in the Northern Cape since 2014, not last year.In 2014, the DA had complained to the Human Rights Commission, who investigated the situation and compiled a report on it.Jooste said the commission had then, already, referred to the &ldquo;degrading and humiliating&rdquo; living conditions of those patients.&ldquo;Despite these findings, the Northern Cape health department has failed to provide these patients with adequate mental health care facilities.&rdquo;Jooste said the Kimberley Psychiatric Hospital, which should have been completed in 2008 was still not ready, despite construction work being continuing for nearly 10 years. &ldquo;And [it&rsquo;s] costing R1 billion, four times the initial estimate.&rdquo;
