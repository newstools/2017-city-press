The conditions of his release state that he may not obstruct the work of the police on campus and that he may not intimidate staff members of the tertiary institution. A number of the 11 justices of the Constitutional Court expressed concerns that Khanyile was being detained without a trial date for a long period of time and questioned why he was the only student leader to remain behind bars despite protest action having come to an end. Khanyile wrote his final exams behind bars and passed with four distinctions.
