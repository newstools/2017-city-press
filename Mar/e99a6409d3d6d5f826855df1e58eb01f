Despite a heartwarming memorial service held last week in honour of veteran actor Joe &ldquo;S&rsquo;Dumo&rdquo; Mafela, the list of people who took to the podium to say a few more words at his funeral was long at University of Johannesburg's Soweto Campus.Reverend Vukile Mehana also prolonged the sermon, which some say was done on purpose to give the funeral of struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada sufficient time and space at the Westpark Cemetery where Mafela was also scheduled to be buried.Mafela died at the age of 75 following a car crash on the M1 in Johannesburg on the night of March 18.People were left in tears when Ophelia Mulelu described her uncle as a &ldquo;unique brand that never imitated anyone in the (comedy film and TV series) industry&rdquo;. &ldquo;He was the one person I always looked up to, and I have cherished every moment I had with him,&rdquo; she lamented.The Soweto Gospel Choir kept the audience on its feet with its cheerful music as the crowd cheered and ululated particularly when one of his signature songs &ldquo;S'gudi &lsquo;snayisi&rdquo; was sung.Mafela&rsquo;s niece Wanga Muleka had written a poem honouring her uncle concluding it by saying: &ldquo;I am very grateful for the times we spent with him.&rdquo; Actress Thembi Mtshali, who shared a stage with Mafela in TV sitcom S'gudi &lsquo;snayisi, told the audience that she felt &ldquo;devastated&rdquo; by the untimely death of her friend Sdumo. She almost did not believe the news she read on social media when his death trended.&ldquo;He was one person who taught me about the media industry and also shared many words of wisdom,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We used to travel together visiting places like Swaziland and he groomed me. I knew him while I was young, those were the times I got in the media industry,&rdquo; said the teary Mtshali.She also challenged writers and documentary producers to endeavour to document stories of veterans such as Sdumo including their struggles to make it in the industry under difficult political circumstances.Tony Kgoroge actor and director said there was no doubt Sdumo was loved by many in the industry and the world at large. He said he believed the nation has lost a legend that will be remembered through his craft.
