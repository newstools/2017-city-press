The South African Music Awards are going back to their original home, the Sun City Superbowl, on the weekend of May 26 after a three-year stint at the Durban International Convention Centre. The resort in the North West province has hosted 14 of the 22 previous ceremonies. “The awards are going to be interesting and also unique this year because we will be having African categories and also more religious performances, or collaborations during the event,” Kolo Sechele, event and logistic manger, said. The organiser, the Recording Industry of South Africa, promised a party “fit for our country and the continent’s finest musicians”. The awards are known to showcase the country’s finest musical talent. And to mark the 23rd edition of the event, three new categories have been introduced. These are best African indigenous gospel album, best Africa artist album and best Afro-pop album. The judging process started in November and the nominations are typically announced at the end of March. The show is broadcast live on national broadcaster, SABC. The ceremony features live performances as once-off collaborations by a selection of nominees. Organisers said that with a number of music lovers that the awards attract, the Bokone Bophirima province (North West) was set to be abuzz with entertainment and loads of activities. “We are delighted that villages, townships and small dorpies (towns) stand to benefit from this event through a number of build-up activities such as mini-festivals, artist development workshops among others,” Risa said.
