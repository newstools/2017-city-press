For 23 years, since 1994, a group of taxi owners in Freedom Park informal settlement in the southwest of Johannesburg have tried to register their association with the authorities.The Naturena/Devland Taxi Association has been turned down and &ldquo;frustrated&rdquo; because &ldquo;the area still needed more development&rdquo;, &ldquo;the informal settlement built in the area can be removed at any time&rdquo;, &ldquo;the route has been allocated to another association&rdquo;, &ldquo;applications forms are incorrect&rdquo; and, later, &ldquo;registrations had closed&rdquo;.During that period conflict between rival associations resulted in drive-by shootings and people dying, including an ANC councillor.One person was also assaulted, stabbed and admitted to Baragwanath Hospital; another was hit with a pick-axe in the neck &ndash; resulting in a stroke; another person still has a bullet stuck in their foot, City Press heard.In the meantime the nearby Johannesburg Southern Suburbs Taxi Association &ndash; commonly known as Eldos &ndash; and the Bara City Taxi Owners Association were servicing the routes in Freedom Park.This week matters came to a head as Naturena/Devland Taxi Association members threatened to take their grievances to the street, forcing a marathon of meetings with government officials who are desperately trying to prevent the association from staging a protest to the premier&rsquo;s office next Wednesday.The march, supported by community members, had initially been scheduled for Friday but was moved back due to ongoing talks.Anticipating that the tensions were likely to rise again, members of Naturena/Devland Taxi Association have enlisted the services of a KwaZulu-Natal-based security company, Black-Watch, to protect its members from any potential attacks.Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Ismail Vadi said he was not aware that taxi owners were taking extra measures to protect themselves, saying that &ldquo;it will request the community safety department to investigate and report on the matter&rdquo;.However, representative from Black-Watch, Norma Mbatha, said Vadi &ldquo;does not seem to know what is happening in his office or he is economical with the truth&rdquo;, citing recent correspondences including meetings, telephone calls, emails and WhatsApp messages with the MEC and his office.Mbatha said Black-Watch &ldquo;offered to mediate between the concerning parties to avoid further bloodshed and the killing of Naturena/Devland Taxi Association executive committee and its members and in getting to the bottom of the matter in a legal and peaceful manner&rdquo;.&ldquo;We pleaded with the members to put their frustrations on hold and avoid any provocations and violence from their part,&rdquo; she said.Vadi said the Naturena/Devland Taxi Association&rsquo;s application was declined by the erstwhile registrar (of minibus taxi associations) in about 2004 because the alleged application did not meet the legal requirements and/or conditions for registration of an association.&ldquo;The Naturena/Devland Taxi Association was never registered as a taxi association by the registrar, the national department of transport or with the Gauteng department of roads and transport,&rdquo; he said.He said the association &ldquo;had not gone through the legal processes to fully or conditionally register as a taxi association. Hence, all former registrars in Gauteng had not registered the &lsquo;association&rsquo;.&rdquo;&ldquo;It has not produced any confirmation of an application for registration, nor any application forms for the registration of taxi associations [ARTA forms], to show that it had applied for registration,&rdquo; said Vadi.He said that &ldquo;as the office of the registrar no longer exists&rdquo;, no new taxi associations were being registered with the Gauteng department of roads and transport or the national department of transport.However, Mbatha said the Naturena/Devland Taxi Association was not a new registration because detailed attempts to register on many times were sabotaged, adding that department was in possession of a trail of documents to support the taxi owners&rsquo; case &ndash; some of which she showed to City Press.She said &ldquo;the department of roads and transport has fuelled the conflicts in the area and using the iron fist in resolving the matter&rdquo;.Vadi, who denied allegations that he was a brother-in-law to one of the taxi bosses in Eldorado Park, said the department monitored the operations of all registered associations on the routes for compliance and where it received reports of possible taxi related conflicts.He said the Naturena/Devland Taxi Association had been provided with an explanation why it could not be registered. &ldquo;Together with officials from the department of community safety, we had on previous occasions intervened in taxi related conflicts in Eldorado Park, Freedom Park and Devland.&rdquo;The memorandum to Premier David Makhura&rsquo;s office next Wednesday was set to make demands that the Gauteng department of roads and transport must, with immediate effect, recognise and register Naturena/Devland Taxi Association as a taxi association as well as an independent investigation into Vadi, certain officials in his department, some members of Eldos and South Africa National Taxi Council &ldquo;in order to uncover whether or not such relationships have any bearing into the refusal by the department to recognise and register Naturena/Devland Taxi Association&rdquo;.The Naturena/Devland Taxi Association also wanted an independent investigation into the involvement of Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department seniors in a taxi violence incident on April 1 2016 at about 6.30am in which members of the taxi association were shot at and assaulted.
