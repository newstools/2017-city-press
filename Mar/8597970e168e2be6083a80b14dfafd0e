Former African Union Commission chairperson Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma arrived to much song and dance by members of the ANC who waited most of Wednesday morning to welcome her at OR Tambo International airport. Dlamini-Zuma returned from Ethiopia where she’d wrapped up her duties at the AU and was greeted by dozens of ANC Women’s League and ANC Youth League supporters. She handed over the reins on Tuesday night to new African Union Commission chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chad’s former foreign minister. Dlamini-Zuma is expected to re-enter the South African political landscape with many supporting her to succeed President Jacob Zuma, who himself said the country was ready for a woman president. Zuma steps down as ANC leader in December. “Thank you so much for welcoming me. I’ve been away for almost four and a half years working at the AU. I was sent by the ANC, the government and the continental leadership. “The four years have been a very interesting experience for me. I’ve learnt a lot and I will share that with you when I visit you,” Dlamini-Zuma said when she addressed the supporters.
