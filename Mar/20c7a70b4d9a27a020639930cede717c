Following last night’s Nedbank Cup last 16 draw in Randburg, Bidvest Wits defender Siboniso Gaxa says they are not taking any game, especially one against National First Division side Jomo Cosmos, lightly. “Jomo [Sono] is an intelligent man. He has a lot of experience and his side is good in cup games, but we don’t underestimate any team that we play,” he said. The Clever Boys, who top the PSL log and are tied with Cape Town City on 38 points, will visit Cosmos, who beat United Rovers 3-0 in the Nedbank Cup’s round of 32. The former Kaizer Chiefs player believes that they will overcome their opponents despite the congested fixtures that lay ahead. Wits face African giants Al Ahly in the CAF Champions League second leg but Gaxa was patriotic in his assessment: “We have lost our first match but we are looking forward to the challenge, we are not only playing for ourselves but for the whole country”. Last week, Wits lost 1-0 in the first leg but will hope to overcome this slight margin when they host the Egyptian team this Sunday. The other Nedbank Cup draw saw the bigger sides avoid each other with Chiefs travelling to lower division side Acornbush United, who claimed a major win when they defeated Cape Town City 1-0. Orlando Pirates will face Free State Stars in Bethlehem after breaking a 12-game winless streak against EC Bees with a 3-1 victory. African champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who faced minnows Mariveni United in the previous round, were drawn against PSL rivals Golden Arrows. The last 16 matches are scheduled for April 5-9.
