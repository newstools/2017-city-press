The grants crisis, Brian Molefe’s future and accountability will take centre stage this afternoon in Parliament when President Jacob Zuma will once again be in the hot seat. Zuma will field questions on Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and former Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe in his first question-and-answer session in Parliament this year. Zuma has not appeared in the National Assembly since the three days of fiery debate and replies on his State of the Nation Address in February. Inkatha Freedom Party member of Parliament Liesl van der Merwe will ask Zuma if he planned to take disciplinary action against Dlamini for “allegedly leading her department into a national grant pay-out crisis”. National Freedom Party MP Sicelo Mabika will ask if Zuma intended to appoint Molefe to an executive position given his implication in matters discussed in the Public Protector’s State of Capture report. Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane will ask Zuma what steps he has taken to ensure that all members of the executive, those who assumed public office and those appointed by the president showed “accountability, integrity and respect for the public and rule of law”. ANC MP Priscilla Mantashe will ask what role labour and industry would play in tackling inequality and economic exclusion. ANC MP Moses Masango will ask what role government is playing in helping end the conflict in Israel and Palestine. Proceedings will begin at 2pm.
