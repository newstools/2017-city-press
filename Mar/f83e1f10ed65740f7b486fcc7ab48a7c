Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa says children should be exposed to career choices much earlier in life because they will then &ldquo;make informed&rdquo; career choices.&ldquo;It is about ending the cycle of poverty, overcoming the devastating legacy of apartheid and colonialism,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said addressing the national skills conference in Centurion today.Ramaphosa said that the skills deficit that the economy faced today was a direct consequence of the racially segregated education system of our past &ndash; &ldquo;apartheid policies deliberately denied black South Africans access to quality education and the skills required to advance beyond the most rudimentary occupations in the labour market&rdquo;.He said the government had implemented policies to reverse the racial inequalities in education, had expanded access to both basic and higher education and improved the skills of all South Africans.&ldquo;To better direct our efforts, we have developed the white paper for post-school education and training for the future of skills development in South Africa. It is our nation&rsquo;s instrument to deepen the transformation of the whole post-schooling sector,&rdquo; Ramaphosa added.The deputy president also used the address to condemn the disruptions that unfolded at the higher education convention chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke last week.The two-day forum was brought to a standstill when students threw chairs and water bottles at each other.The sitting was aimed at finding a solution to the funding crisis in higher education. &ldquo;It is unacceptable for that kind of unruly behaviour when we&rsquo;re trying to find solutions and craft ways of charting a way forward for the future of our students,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said.He urged South Africans to learn to tolerate and to listen to each other&rsquo;s views without being violent to one another.&ldquo;We cannot have a South Africa of unruly people, who because they are unhappy with this person or that person, they start behaving in a most unacceptable manner.&rdquo;Ramaphosa concluded the conference with the plea for organisations to work together to address challenges and propose practical solutions.&ldquo;This conference must evaluate the progress we have made in implementing the [white paper] policy since November 2013.&ldquo;In all that we do, let us ensure that we pay attention to the voices of students and employers,&rdquo; he closed off.
