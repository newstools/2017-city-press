ANC struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada’s recovery from his operation has been “slower than hoped for”, the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation said on Wednesday. The foundation’s director, Neeshan Balton, said today that Kathrada had “experienced several health-related setbacks, making the prognosis of his illness unpredictable”. “He remains in hospital with everything being done to assist his recovery,” Balton said. Kathrada (87) was admitted to a Johannesburg hospital on March 4 for surgery relating to clotting on the brain. Kathrada was initially admitted for dehydration, but doctors later picked up the blood clot, which was subsequently removed. Doctors said his age was the major factor that was complicating and slowing down his recovery. The ANC sent its wishes for a speedy recovery to the stalwart, urging South Africans “to continue their outpouring of support and thoughtful prayers for Comrade Kathrada and his family during this time.” President Jacob Zuma also extended well wishes to Kathrada. “We send good wishes to our liberation struggle stalwart and one of our three surviving Rivonia trialists. We urge the nation to keep him and his family in their thoughts and prayers at this time,” Zuma said. Balton said visits from members of the public were still not permitted due to hospital regulations and the necessity for a restful period of recovery. “We have been overwhelmed by the immense support, both from within South Africa and abroad. We continue asking for your prayers during this period, both for Mr Kathrada and his family and friends,” Balton said. Kathrada is one of three Rivonia Trialists still alive today; the other two being Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg. Along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba and Elias Motsoaledi, they were sentenced in 1964 to life imprisonment on Robben Island during the famous Rivonia Trial.
