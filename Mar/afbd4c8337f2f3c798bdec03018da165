The Economic Freedom Fighters have advised the ANC to avoid making decisions that &ldquo;might be cancelled by those who will be in power in 2022&rdquo;.This was in response to the news that Durban will no longer be the host city for the 2022 Commonwealth Games.The EFF said yesterday that it welcomed the cancellation of Durban as hosts.The party also said that it didn&rsquo;t recognise the Commonwealth as a legitimate body. It was an association of colonies of Britain and South Africa should break free from its colonial linkages and past, it said. &ldquo;South Africa does not owe its allegiance to the colonial Britain and should therefore cut all ties to colonial masters,&rdquo; the statement read.Likening the Commonwealth Games with the 2010 Football World Cup, the EFF said that hosting events of this nature had no meaningful contribution to the lives of ordinary people. Instead it benefits multinational corporations and the elite, the statement said.Sports minister Fikile Mbalula held a media briefing in Durban on Tuesday morning to provide clarity on why South Africa failed to secure hosting rights for the 2022 Commonwealth Games.The Commonwealth Games Federation announced on Monday that Durban could not host the international multi-sport event due to financial issues and that the local organising committee had missed several deadlines since being awarded the Games in 2015. Liverpool and Birmingham were spearheaded as possible emergency hosts.Mbalula said the government was not prepared to bankrupt the country by committing to spending money that it didn&rsquo;t have.In a Facebook post, he stated that he was &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; at the announcement by the games federation and &ldquo;while we disagree with the contents of the statement we respect its decision as the right holder and wish to retrace our footsteps leading us to this point&rdquo;.Mbalula went on to explain that when the Games were awarded to South Africa, South Africa had not signed the host city agreement. &ldquo;Clauses in the agreement were seriously going to compromise South Africa and government was not prepared to sign an open-ended guarantee,&rdquo; he said.The clauses in the agreement that were going to compromise South Africa if we signed the Host City Agreement #Durban2022 pic.twitter.com/ssxXAikmC3Opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, wanted Mbalula to explain to Parliament why R118 million was wasted on the Commonwealth bid. The DA &ldquo;continuously warned&rdquo; the eThekwini Municipality, Minister Mbalula and the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee that the Commonwealth Games were too expensive and that South Africa did not have the financial means to host.&ldquo;The entire bidding process was doomed from the start. South Africa was ill-prepared and underfinanced,&rdquo; they said.&ldquo;Minister Mbalula must, therefore, account to Parliament as to why he chose to ignore the very obvious signs that South Africa was simply not financially ready to host this event and provide a detailed breakdown of the costs that were incurred during the bidding process,&rdquo; the demands state.Mbalula responded on Twitter saying: &ldquo;As expected, @Our_DA will grandstand on this issue. Gov was not going to spend billions that weren&rsquo;t budgeted for the sake of hosting.&rdquo;
