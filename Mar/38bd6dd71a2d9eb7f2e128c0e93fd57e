On Wednesday March 15, the 2017 car of the year will be announced. Travel Torque’s Melinda Ferguson is placing bets that Volkswagen will rev home with the title. Despite the VW global emissions scandal that hit headline news in late 2015, costing Volkswagen billions of dollars in fines and lawsuits, South Africans have responded to the biggest scandal in the German manufacturer’s history, as though it never existed. The much-loved brand is still firmly placed as the second most successful local brand, only beaten by Toyota. It’s continued to enjoy its seventh year of domination in the passenger car market with the VW Polo Vivo, followed by the Polo, as the top-selling passenger car, which goes to show that sometimes oil is thicker than scandals. In a few days the South African Guild of Motoring Journalists will announce the 2017 car of the year at a gala banquet in Midrand. VW South Africa revs into the competition with not one, but two finalists this year – the hugely impressive VW Passat which oozes space, quality and luxury, and the on and off road technical SUV maestro, the VW Tiguan.
