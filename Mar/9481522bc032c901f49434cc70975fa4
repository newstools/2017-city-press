President Jacob Zuma has tightened his grip on the government&rsquo;s communication infrastructure.He announced on Monday that he had reconstituted the inter-ministerial committee on information and publicity. He will be the chairperson, assisted by Communications Minister Faith Muthambi.Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe has been the committee&rsquo;s chairperson. In 2014, Radebe took over from Muthambi after three months into her term as communications minister, as she apparently couldn&rsquo;t quite cut it as the face of the government&rsquo;s communications. The parliamentary ad hoc committee that investigated the SABC board recommended that Zuma should reconsider Muthambi&rsquo;s post in his Cabinet, but Muthambi indicated that she would take this report on judicial review.Nevertheless, since the report was accepted in the National Assembly, Muthambi has accompanied Zuma on at least two events when she was supposed to appear in Parliament. Zuma also appointed her as acting justice minister.The announcement came hot on the heels of his decision to call Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, back from overseas trips to drum up international investment.Speculation is rife that the intention was to reshuffle his Cabinet, sidelining Gordhan and Jonas, but Gordhan&rsquo;s name still appears on the list of ministers who serve on the committee.Also on this list is State Security Minister David Mahlobo &ndash; who recently raised eyebrows with his suggestion that the government should regulate social media. It was the State Security Agency, of which he is the political head, that put a signal blocker in the press gallery during the 2015 state of the nation address.Zuma&rsquo;s spokesperson, Bongani Ngqulunga, said that this completed the &ldquo;transitional period&rdquo; during which Radebe was responsible for the committee.&ldquo;The location of the communication function in the communication ministry will centralise communication and should improve the management of Government Communication and Information System (GCIS), which will now report to one minister, the minister of communications,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;President Zuma has thanked Minister Radebe for his capable management of the function until the hand over to its rightful department.&rdquo;The members of the committee are:&bull; Communications Minister Faith Muthambi;&bull; Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Jeff Radebe;&bull; Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa;&bull; Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister David van Rooyen;&bull; Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel;&bull; Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa;&bull; Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan;&bull; International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane;&bull; Police Minister Nathi Nhleko;&bull; Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini;&bull; State Security Minister David Mahlobo;&bull; Telecommunications and Postal Services Minister Siyabonga Cwele;&bull; Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies; and &bull; Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.
