The Western Cape provincial parliament kicked off the first of two public hearings into the long-delayed and highly controversial Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act Amendment Bill.Initially passed just before the 2014 national elections, President Jacob Zuma held back from signing the bill into law, instead referring it back to Parliament due to concerns about whether it would pass constitutional muster.Among those making submissions before the standing committee on economic opportunities, tourism and agriculture were the Chamber of Mines, the South African Oil and Gas Alliance for Shale Gas, the Onshore Petroleum Association of South Africa and the Offshore Petroleum Association of South Africa and the Legal Resources Centre, while the House of Traditional Leaders made written submissions.In its submission, the Legal Resource Centre said the public hearings were unlawful and should be rejected. The centre stressed that it was outright contesting the mineral resources department&rsquo;s introduction of the new amendments to the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Development Amendment Bill.These amendments tackled concerns of the offshore petroleum industry and dealt with carried interest and state participation in ventures.Henk Smith from the Legal Resources Centre stressed that the bill, if passed, would be challenged in the Constitutional Court.&ldquo;We agree with the Western Cape government that the bill must not be approved. We request that you reject the bill and start the process afresh,&rdquo; Smith told the committee.Smith stressed that the principal demand was that the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act be explicitly incorporated into the amended mining bill and that no mining on communal land be allowed without community consent.The shale gas industry was in support of the department&rsquo;s amendment proposal, but highlighted a few key additional modifications that could benefit the country.These included the incorporation of a shale gas definition to allow for the addressing of a few shale gas specific challenges and provision, incorporating flexibility for downward adjustment of the state carried interest during the exploration phase to support shale gas exploration investments and, ultimately, a more competitive gas production cost and consequential market price and amending the exploration timelines.Chairperson of the standing committee on economic opportunities, tourism and agriculture, Beverley Sch&auml;fer said it was deeply concerning that the department placed them in a difficult position, because it had not followed parliamentary process.&ldquo;We will be seeking legal advice on this matter to ensure that the public participation process is not a wasted one. We believe it is vital to hear from industry experts, stakeholders and community at large about the impact of such an important bill.&rdquo;Sch&auml;fer said given the 11.5% decrease during the fourth quarter of 2016 in the mining sector it was imperative that informed decisions were made.Western Cape Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde, in his written comments to the committee, stressed that the provincial government did not support the amendment bill in its current form.Asked for comment, Winde said the amendment bill has been delayed extensively due to national government&rsquo;s uncertainty over which department had jurisdiction over oil and gas resources.&ldquo;In its current from the bill fails to address whether mineral resources or energy is the lead department,&rdquo; said Winde.&ldquo;National [government&rsquo;s] uncertainty is threatening the country&rsquo;s brand as an investment destination and several projects have been delayed or cancelled. Both energy and oil and gas are key focus areas, and we must create an enabling environment for private sector investment into these sectors,&rdquo; he stressed.A second round of hearings will be held on Friday in Vredendal on the West Coast. &ndash; TLM
