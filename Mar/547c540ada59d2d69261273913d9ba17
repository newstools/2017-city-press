Progressive Professionals Forum president Mzwanele Manyi has named &ldquo;too many commitments&rdquo; as the reason for him resigning from his position as head of policy in the Black Business Council after only six months in office. Manyi resigned on Monday, citing that he had too many responsibilities in his other portfolios which he held including the PPF and Decolonisation Foundation, both of which he heads.Having recently launched the young wing of PPF and with a student chapter of the organisation, Manyi said he has his hands full with commitments. &ldquo;I have a lot of commitments right now and the student chapter [of the PPF] will also need a lot of my time in order to guide them. I will still be part of the national council, which is the body where the office bearers account to because I will be wearing my hat of PPF president,&rdquo; Manyi said.Black Business Council president Danisa Baloyi said the organisation was happy with the reasons Manyi mentioned in his letter of resignation and had no reason to doubt him. &ldquo;We wish him all the best in his endeavours,&rdquo; she added.Manyi was only voted into the position last October but would still form part of its national council because the PPF was a member organisation of the council.Manyi is a former president of Black Management Forum, former chief executive of Government Communications and Information Systems, and former Cabinet spokesperson.He was vocal about his dissatisfaction with the recent budget speech delivered by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and went as far as calling for his resignation, with the minister allegedly not taking kindly to the remarks.Gordhan later met with the Black Business Council, ironed out issues the organisation had with him and both issued a combined statement stating that the meeting &ldquo;was characterised by robust and frank discussions&rdquo;.
