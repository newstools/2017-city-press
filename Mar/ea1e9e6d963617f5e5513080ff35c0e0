The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has labelled claims that President Jacob Zuma has been barred from attending Ahmed Kathrada&rsquo;s funeral as rumours.The foundation&rsquo;s director, Neeshan Bolton, says Zuma can attend, but will not be one of the speakers. &ldquo;President Zuma does not feature as a speaker on the programme and neither does Cyril Ramaphosa. The programme will be hosted by the foundation and the board members of the foundation will be speaking. There will also be some from the ANC, Cosatu and the SACP,&rdquo; Bolton said.The rumours that the Kathrada family asked Zuma not to attend the funeral started on Tuesday afternoon.Last year Kathrada wrote an open letter to Zuma asking him to resign following the Constitutional Court&rsquo;s judgment on Nkandla.&ldquo;I know that if I were in the president&rsquo;s shoes, I would step down with immediate effect. I believe that is what would help the country find its way out of a path that it never imagined it would be on, but one that it must move out of soon. Today I appeal to our president to submit to the will of the people and resign,&rdquo; wrote Kathrada.The struggle stalwart is remembered by many for his fearless stance in calling leaders to account and his criticism of the ANC.&ldquo;A warm, courageous, compassionate and resolute person, Kathy will be missed by the many people whose lives he touched and enriched,&rdquo; said Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in a message issued by the Presidency on Tuesday.Bolton said that the funeral was open to anyone who wishes to attend.He added that the foundation was working together with the presidency on a national funeral for Kathrada.
