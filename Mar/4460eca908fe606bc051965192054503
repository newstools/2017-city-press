Opposition parties are once again trying the no-confidence route against President Jacob Zuma.The Economic Freedom Fighters is getting legal advice regarding possible action, and the Democratic Alliance on Thursday announced its decision to table a motion of no confidence in Zuma in Parliament.This followed the revelation by South African Communist Party second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila that Zuma had expressed his intention to axe Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas.The motion will be tabled in terms of Section 102 of the Constitution, DA leader Mmusi Maimane has said."At a time when nine million South Africans are without work and our fragile economy requires leadership and clear policy direction, President Zuma continues to play &lsquo;Russian Roulette&rsquo; with our economy and the future of our country," said Maimane."I have therefore written to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Baleka Mbete, in this regard, indicating our intention to have the motion debated and voted on by Parliament once it is back in session."EFF leader Julius Malema told Gauteng&rsquo;s Power FM talk radio station that his party was seeking legal advice on the option of a motion of no confidence against Zuma. &ldquo;This is the end of him. We must prepare ourselves for a new president,&rdquo; said Malema.
