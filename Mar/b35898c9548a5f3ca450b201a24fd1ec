Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments has hit back after Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&rsquo;s lawyer, Jeremy Gauntlett, called on the company to withdraw from the court hearing. Oakbay and the finance minister are battling it out in court over Gordhan&rsquo;s October 2016 court application, which seeks protection from intervening in the banks&rsquo; decision to close the bank accounts of Oakbay.&ldquo;Oakbay Investments has suffered unjustified and severe reputational damage as a result of the minister&rsquo;s application,&rdquo; Oakbay&rsquo;s acting chief executive Ronica Ragavan said today.The infamous Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) certificate listing 72 suspicious transactions, as well as Deputy Finance Minister Mscebisi Jonas&rsquo; claims about being offered Gordhan&rsquo;s job by the Guptas, were struck off by the court yesterday.Ragavan said this showed the true motives behind Gordhan&rsquo;s application.&ldquo;His inclusion of the FIC report and Deputy Minister Jonas&rsquo; affidavit, which were both struck off yesterday, clearly demonstrate the motives that sit behind the application,&rdquo; Ragavan said.&ldquo;We will continue to argue in court for this unnecessary application, which is a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money and the court&rsquo;s time, to be dismissed. As the architect of the application and the campaign to smear Oakbay, if anyone is to withdraw it should be the minister.&rdquo;
