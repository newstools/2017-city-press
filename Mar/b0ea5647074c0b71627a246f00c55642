They said that Zuma told officials from the party, which is allied to the ANC, during a meeting on Monday in Johannesburg. Bloomberg's sources were apparently present and asked not to be identified because a public statement had not been made.He didn&rsquo;t say when he planned to fire Gordhan.Zuma ordered Gordhan to cancel meetings with investors in the UK and the US and return home on Monday, a day after he had flown to London to begin the week-long roadshow.According to Bloomberg, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the people were misinformed.Zuma instructed Gordhan and his National Treasury team to immediately return home from an international roadshow without giving reasons for this move.This news sparked speculation that Zuma will soon reshuffle his Cabinet and replace Gordhan as finance minister. &ldquo;President Jacob Zuma has instructed the Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan and Deputy Minister Mcebisi Jonas to cancel the international investment promotion roadshow to the United Kingdom and the United States and return to South Africa immediately,&rdquo; Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said on Monday.

This was a response to the bizarre behaviour of Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, who last year claimed to head a ministerial committee investigation into the closure of the Gupta businesses&rsquo; bank accounts.
