Despite a continuing backlash on his decision to scrap the Jozi@Work programme, Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba maintains the project only served a select few.&ldquo;I stand here today, unperturbed. You see, this programme was a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing,&rdquo; he told News24.&ldquo;Like so many good principles, the Jozi@Work programme had a dark underworld, because when middlemen get awarded multimillion-rand contracts to run these projects they become indebted through their newly achieved wealth.&ldquo;Despite what critics say, this move will not kill work opportunities. Instead it will increase the amount of people who can fairly benefit from these temporary work opportunities,&rdquo; he added.Mashaba received a lot of criticism in early March when he made his plans known to cancel the programme, because many feared the possibility of many jobs that would be lost.&ldquo;I am pleased to announce the end of an era of patronage with Jozi@Work. &ldquo;I maintain that we have to turn the economy of our City around and ensure that real work opportunities are created for our residents.&rdquo;&ldquo;These opportunities will benefit the poorest of our City&sbquo; not the overnight millionaires that the City seems to have prioritised in the past,&rdquo; he said.The ANC was quick to reject this decision and came out saying: &ldquo;Today is a sad day for more than 8000 workers and 112 cooperatives or local companies in Johannesburg.&rdquo; The ANC maintained that their programme created thousands of jobs for the unemployed residents of Johannesburg.Mashaba&rsquo;s announcement led to a mass protest in the Johannesburg CBD.Jozi@Work protesters wreak havoc in Joburg CBD (@CityofJoburgZA) late Wednesday night @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/EhKmxiibNHOn Wednesday, the ANC&rsquo;s Johannesburg spokesperson Jolidee Matongo said Mashaba&rsquo;s decision to scrap the programme was &ldquo;anti-poor&rdquo;. &ldquo;The cancellation of Jozi@Work programme practically condemns 8 000 people to unemployment and prevents a further 50 000 Joburgers from benefiting from the programme over the next four years,&rdquo; Matongo told News24.
