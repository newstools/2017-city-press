After much anticipation, the Gauteng online application system for parents to secure places in schools for their children next year was all systems go this morning. More than 16 000 applications were already lodged within the first 20 minutes of the system going live, according to the Gauteng MEC of education spokesperson, Oupa Bodipe. By 10am, more than 28 000 successful applications were made on the online portal system. &ldquo;The traffic is working well on the system. There are no glitches from our side. However, we did anticipate a larger volume of traffic this year so we are expecting the numbers to increase as the day progresses,&rdquo; Bodipe told City Press. &ldquo;An SMS confirmation will be sent to the parents, after which they will take the SMS and the relevant documentations to the schools which their children have been placed at, in order to register their children at the school itself,&rdquo; Bodipe said.MEC @Lesufi &amp;@GautengProvince Premier David Makhura interact with commuters at Orange Farm #GDE2018Admissions pic.twitter.com/G4tzu8HfOSPremier Makhura &amp; MEC @Lesufi making sure parents apply successfully #GDE2018Admissions @Steve_Mabona @Thobeka_Rare pic.twitter.com/Ihdkw23Dx5#GDE2018Admissions - Remember to take all relevant documents to the school @Lesufi @GautengProvince pic.twitter.com/x71xlyfhBsIn order to accommodate parents who do not have computer or internet access, or who are not computer literate, 65 admission centres have been set up around Gauteng. &ldquo;Parents can go directly to these centres where our officials are ready to assist parents,&rdquo; Bodipe said. Nkhesani Masilela&rsquo;s experience this morning was seamless when she applied for her daughter&rsquo;s Grade 1 placement next year. &ldquo;I was really surprised, because people who had applied last year on the system really had issues so I was anticipating having the same issues,&rdquo; Masilela said. Masilela, who resides in Mabopane, north of Gauteng, applied for schools around the Ga-Rankuwa area, because it would be easier for her daughter to get home after school. &ldquo;There are no street names where we stay, so the system had a list of schools in the area which I could choose from. They then sent a confirmation SMS which was great,&rdquo; she said. Another lady, Carly (last name omitted), experienced only a minor glitch in the system when she applied for her son&rsquo;s Grade 8 placement next year. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t find the school initially, so I moved on to the next step of the application process which mentioned the school in the areas. I don&rsquo;t think there are private schools listed on the site, which is what confused me,&rdquo; she said. Oupa Bodipe confirmed that the online application system only accommodated government schools in Gauteng. Carly&rsquo;s son is at a private school, and she would have preferred to keep him in private schooling but she said that it was simply not viable any more with the economic climate. &ldquo;Look, the only criticism that I have against the online application system is that I applied to two schools, and they both gave me the message that there was a high number of applications for the schools, so there is no guarantee that my son will be placed in these schools. "And of course since it is online and there are thousands of people applying, how do I know I am first in the queue or last? So I am feeling uneasy about that,&rdquo; she said. The online application process is open until midnight on June 12, and the placement of children into schools will commence from July 24.
