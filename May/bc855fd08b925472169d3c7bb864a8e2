Reeve Frosler who joined the South African Under-20 squad only last night, will start from the bench in the Fifa Under-20 World Cup match against Japan this morning (10am SA time). The Bidvest Wits right-back was named among nine substitutes by coach Thabo Senong for the crucial opening match. Besides Frosler, who has had an impressive season with Wits since March, Senong went for the same starting line-up and subs as he did in his chargesâ€™ 2-1 victory in their final preparatory match against Costa Rica. Red-hot striker Luther Singh, who was replaced by Kobamelo Kodisang in that particular game, will lead the attack while captain Tercious Malepe is expected to steady things at the back with Mondli Mpoto keeping his place between the sticks. Attacking midfielder Masilakhe Phohlongo came in as an 88th minute replacement for Sibongakonke Mbatha. He will start on the bench again today. Liam Jordan who came on in the 82nd minute for Keletso Makgalwa, also starts on the bench today. The Group D encounter takes place at the Suwon World Cup Stadium in Suwon, South Korea. Starting lineup: Mondli Mpoto; Thendo Mukumela; Malebogo Modise; Tercious Malepe (C); Sandile Mthethwa; Wiseman Meyiwa; Thabo Cele; Sibongakonke Mbatha; Luther Singh; Grant Margeman; Keletso Makgalwa Subs: Sanele Tshabalala; Khulekani Kubheka; Shane Saralina; Sipho Mbule; Masilakhe Phohlongo; Kobamelo Kodisang; Reeve Frosler; Liam Jordan
