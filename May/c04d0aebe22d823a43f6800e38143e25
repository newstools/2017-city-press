Hundreds of people gathered in Pretoria&rsquo;s Church Square for the #NotInMyName march against women abuse. Recent reports of rape, murder and other gender-based violence sparked the hashtag &ldquo;#MenAreTrash&rdquo; to circulate on social media.

The crowd marched from Church Square to the Union Buildings, where some speakers spoke to the crowd.Our photographer&nbsp;Jacquelyn Guillen was at the march and snapped these pictures:
