The Independent Police Investigative Directorate has launched an urgent application before the North Gauteng High Court seeking to interdict acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane from interfering with their investigation.In the application which was launched on Thursday, Ipid head Robert McBride told the court that Phahlane, North West deputy police commissioner Jan Mabula and others who are being investigated by Ipid have launched their own counter investigation against two Ipid employees.&ldquo;The complaints of corruption and money laundering against the acting national commissioner have been referred to the National Prosecuting Authority,&rdquo; Mcbride&rsquo;s affidavit read.He alleged that Phahlane, in response to the Ipid investigation, has launched various counter investigations led by police officers to investigate Ipid investigators who were investigating him. &ldquo;The acting national commissioner has, in response, himself laid charges against Mr [Mandla] Mahlangu and Mr [Temane] Binang ... the acting national commissioner has made no secret of his active involvement in these process,&rdquo; McBride&rsquo;s statement read. Phahlane is in hot water for enjoying a questionable relationship with a supplier during his tenure as divisional commissioner for forensic services. It was through this supplier that he allegedly bought an R80 000 sound system for his palatial home in Sable Hills Waterfront Estate in Pretoria.He also allegedly paid contractors working on his house in bags of cash from the boot of his car. Phahlane may also face charges of defeating the ends of justice after Ipid investigators tasked with probing him received death threats via SMS.Phahlane, however, denies any wrongdoing and has launched a court application in the high court in Pretoria, seeking to interdict Ipid from investigating him.As the net closes in on Phahlane, City Press has also learnt that the Asset Forfeiture Unit has begun a process to attach assets of his, worth R1 million &ndash; the amount which it believes he accrued by corrupt means.Meanwhile, Phahlane is not going down without a fight.City Press has seen summonses for two Ipid investigators probing Phahlane to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court next Tuesday.The two, namely Mahlangu and Binang &ndash; together with forensic investigator Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan and attorney Sarah Jane Trent &ndash; face charges of fraud, extortion and conspiracy to contravene the Ipid Act.
