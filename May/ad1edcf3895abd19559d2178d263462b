A suicide attack ripped through Kabul&rsquo;s diplomatic district in Afghanistan this morning. At least 80 people have been killed and hundreds have been wounded.According to Al Jazeera, the suspected truck bomb took place near Zanbaq square in the Afgan capital, in an area close to many government offices and foreign embassies. The area is said to be significant due to it being one of the Kabul&rsquo;s busiest and most secure parts.The blast struck close to the German embassy, but it is yet unknown if this was the intended target as there was no immediate claim of responsibility. Al Jazeera&rsquo;s Qais Azimy, reporting from Kabul, said that &ldquo;this was one of the biggest blasts Kabul has ever seen.&rdquo;&ldquo;If that is true, if a truck full of explosives could manage to get to that highly secure part of Kabul, then that is going to raise a lot of questions - not only among those diplomats living in the area, but also Kabul&rsquo;s regular residents,&rdquo;Azimy said. The attack happened during the morning rush hour when everyone was going to work. Initial reports suggest civilians bore the brunt of the casualties.A huge plume of smoke could be seen rising from the area, while houses hundreds of metres away from the blast were damaged, with windows and doors blown off their hinges.&ldquo;The explosion was so loud that it shattered all my windows, did not hear something this big before,&rdquo; Fatima Faizi, a Kabul resident, told Al Jazeera. -Al Jazeera, BBC* This is a developing story.
