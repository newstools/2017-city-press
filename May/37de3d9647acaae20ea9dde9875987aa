I receive complaints from the public about the SAPS call centres and I came here to interact with the management and the call centre agents about ways to improve the way we communicate with the public.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an important centre; we must sustain it. We have a whole bunch of dedicated police officers and young people working here, who are well-trained.&ldquo;South Africans must also acknowledge that these people are not humouring around, not doing their job. If they don&rsquo;t do their job, we&rsquo;ll fire them&rdquo;.Well done @MbalulaFikile for visiting 10111 to motivate the cops and listen to some of the problems. pic.twitter.com/yxXuXR9lBz The minister said he planned to visit more police stations and SAPS centres.&ldquo;Police stations, calls centres and all other SAPS work places must expect me anytime,&rdquo; he said.
