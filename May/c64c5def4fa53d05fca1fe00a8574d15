A furious President Jacob Zuma has threatened his detractors in the ANC not to &ldquo;push him too far&rdquo;.&nbsp;Zuma addressed the party&rsquo;s national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Pretoria after surviving another motion for him to step down. The party&rsquo;s highest decision-making body between conferences debated the motion for two days, with the meeting ending late on Sunday evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was very angry. It was the first time I have seen him so angry,&rdquo; said an NEC source.&nbsp;The source added that Zuma threatened ANC leaders in his closing address to stop criticising him in public as he will no longer continue to keep quiet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been quiet because I don&rsquo;t want to harm the ANC, so continue attacking me in the media and you will see,&rdquo; Zuma is quoted as saying to the ANC NEC. The president told the NEC that it should be the last time he faced a motion of no confidence.&nbsp; Zuma told the meeting he didn&rsquo;t understand calls for him to step down now because he was not standing for re-election at the party&rsquo;s elective conference in December.&nbsp; Zuma is also said to have slammed the Gauteng ANC for blaming him for the party&rsquo;s electoral decline, reminding the province that it had refused to distribute T-shirts bearing his name for the 2016 local government electoral campaign.&nbsp; He blamed the party for losing the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality due to infighting that has plagued the ANC in the metro.&nbsp; Zuma also referred to an alleged plot to poison him in 2014, saying he knew who was behind the plot but did not want to harm the ANC.&nbsp; The NEC debated Zuma&rsquo;s political future after ANC policy guru Joel Netshitenzhe put forward the motion &ndash; the second motion in six months &ndash; for Zuma to vacate his office.&nbsp; Survivor: Zuma style Two NEC members confirmed to News24 that Zuma had survived.&nbsp; A source who attended the meeting told News24 that as many as 70 NEC members spoke for and against the motion.&nbsp; A Zuma supporter claimed that Zuma had the support of most speakers despite earlier confidence expressed by the faction opposing Zuma&rsquo;s leadership that their support had grown.&nbsp; Unconfirmed reports were that at least 18 NEC members, including Cabinet ministers, supported Netshitenzhe&rsquo;s motion, but that considerably more ANC leaders spoke against the motion for Zuma to step down.&nbsp; Zuma supporters said it was easier to &ldquo;crush&rdquo; the motion this time than in November when former tourism minister Derek Hanekom unexpectedly tabled a motion for Zuma to go.&nbsp; The ANC is expected to brief the media later today.&nbsp; The party&rsquo;s NEC meeting came as three separate media exposes made claims against the Treasury, Zuma, and key government ministers.City Press reported that a series of leaked emails purportedly show a draft of an email by Zuma&rsquo;s son Duduzane, asking that the United Arab Emirates support his plan to set up a second family home there.The president&rsquo;s main personal residence is currently in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal, fortified by R249 million worth of security retrofits paid for by taxpayers.
