Hugh Masekela has sustained a shoulder injury and has been booked off until August.&ldquo;Hugh fell and dislocated his right shoulder on April 7 whilst in Morocco, and the fall exacerbated an old injury that Hugh sustained in 1993,&rdquo; his management team said. They also confirmed that due to scheduled surgery, and recovery period to follow, Masekela&rsquo;s upcoming performances will be cancelled. This includes Kaya FM &amp; Bassline Live Present show at the Lyric Theatre on June 11. Masekela is due to undergo a minor operation on Monday to repair tendon and ligament damage.&ldquo;After the operation the doctor has insisted that Hugh take an eight-week hiatus from all activity, to allow the shoulder to fully recover. This means no rehearsals or performances, no long-distance travel, no carrying or lifting of any kind, and regular, weekly physiotherapy,&rdquo; his team said.Masekela is expected to return to the stage after Tuesday, August 1. &ldquo;Hugh is disappointed to let his fans down, but his health is a top priority.&rdquo;&ldquo;We fully support Bra Hugh in his decision to put his health first and wish him a speedy recovery. We look forward to hosting him on our stage soon,&rdquo; his team added.
