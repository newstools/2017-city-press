The National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa) has expressed their shock and anger at the death of 29-year-old Eskom employee Thembisile Yende. Yende, a learner artisan at the power utility, was reported missing on May 17 and her body was discovered locked in her office on May 29, two weeks after she went missing. The circumstances surrounding her death are still unclear, but Eskom management have pledged their support as the police continues its investigation. &ldquo;Eskom is saddened by the discovery of the body of its employee Thembisile Yende at the Springs substation and are working closely with the South African Police Services to establish the circumstances under which she has passed away,&rdquo; Eskom management said yesterday in a statement. &ldquo;We pray that her soul rests in peace and that God gives her family, colleagues and friends strength during this difficult time,&rdquo; Eskom&rsquo;s group executive for human resources, Elsie Pule, said. Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim called on Eskom to &ldquo;leave no stone unturned&rdquo; in establishing the circumstances surrounding Yende&rsquo;s death. During its initial investigation Eskom had seen Yende&rsquo;s car in the car park of their premises in Springs and concluded that nothing was amiss. &ldquo;We hope the investigation will shed light on whether Eskom was indeed negligent in the manner in which the death of our member was handled. Secondly, adding to our dismay as a union is that a previous &lsquo;investigation&rsquo; by Eskom yielded nothing and it would seem the employer got relaxed because he saw her vehicle in the car park,&rdquo; Numsa acting spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi said. Yende, who was a Numsa member, leaves behind a 6-year-old son and family in Springs.
