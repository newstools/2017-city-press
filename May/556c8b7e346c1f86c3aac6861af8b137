Former president of the Black Management Forum George Negota passed away on Sunday morning due to illness. Negota was president of BMF from 1984 until 1986 before later being a director of the ANC’s department of manpower development in the early 1990s. “During his presidency, the BMF broadened its reach establishing regional structures across the country. Previously it had been a Transvaal [now Gauteng] based organisation,” the organisation said. “His passing on is a great loss to our organisation. As the BMF, we appreciate the mark he has made in the formation and leadership of our organisation. His contribution to the transformation landscape and in managerial leadership development will forever be remembered,” the BMF said. Family spokesperson Dan Nefolovhodwe said Negota was ill and hospitalised at the time of his death. “He was running his own law in Randburg and had several family businesses,” he added. A memorial service will be held for him in Johannesburg on Wednesday followed by another at his home in Sinthumule in Makhado, Limpopo, before the funeral at the same venue on Saturday.
