The kaleidoscope of cocktails served at the Sun City Super Bowl fitted in perfectly with the revamped venue for the 23rd South African Music Awards (Samas). This was a chic celebration of Africa Month on Friday night – the ideal curtain raiser for the main Sama 23 shindig on Saturday. Guests were dressed to the nines, with most artists looking stylish in their cultural attire, and strutting like kings and queens. The event was hosted by comedian and presenter Tumi Morake, who flew solo and yet managed to keep the audience attentive and entertained. Somizi Mhlongo was reserved for Saturday’s big event. Surprisingly, Morake wore a stunning weave. The last time we saw her at the Samsung S8 launch in Pretoria she was rocking short hair. Looking like an executive, Luthando “Lootlove” Shosha slayed in a white suit and pink coat, while her rapper boyfriend Sizwe “Reason” Moeketsi complemented her in a black suit. The couple, who were probably candidates for best dressed, had the attention of the paparazzi. Even social media was buzzing with reviews, although these included mixed feelings from the public. One would have thought the heads bobbing to Black Motion’s performance were choreographed as the crowd took in the entertainment. Maskandi sensation Shwi noMtekhala took over and equally rocked the house. They gave what is probably their best performance to date – and this was just the first night of Sama 23. Late singer S’fiso Ncwane, who won two awards on the night, was honoured with a moment of silence. He might be gone, but his music is still celebrated by many. After that, the meal was served and drinks flowed freely.
