President Jacob Zuma may have been delivering the presidency&rsquo;s budget vote in the National Assembly on Wednesday, but that didn&rsquo;t stop parliamentarians from heckling him, or journalists from finding more interesting things to tweet about.From ANC MP Lindiwe Sisulu&rsquo;s chocolate to Zuma appearing to nod off during his deputy&rsquo;s address, here are the more entertaining moments of today&rsquo;s Parliament events:As usual DA MPs were like yapping Chihuahuas, and heckled Zuma right from the beginning. Without mention of the weekend&rsquo;s leaked Gupta emails, Zuma said a probe into state capture would help &ldquo;recover the facts and remove rumours&rdquo;.READ:&nbsp;Gupta emails confirm family&rsquo;s extravagant Dubai palace&ldquo;What has caused a delay is the manner the former Public Protector directed the inquiry to be done, that infringes on the rights of the president,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will cause problems...&rdquo; he said, with a Democratic Alliance MP interjecting in the characteristic pause in Zuma&rsquo;s speech: &ldquo;For you!&rdquo; Undeterred, Zuma explained that he felt it would be a problem if the Chief Justice appointed the commission as former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela directed, because it would create a precedent, and it undermined the principle of separation of powers. &ldquo;We want you in the tjoekie [behind bars]!&rdquo; DA chief whip John Steenhuisen interjected.Zuma may have tried to avoid the issues, but opposition parliamentarians were sure to bring his &ldquo;Dubai exit plan&rdquo; into Parliament. DA MPs heckling President Zuma from the get go. "Dubai" "Saxonwold" "when are you going?" DA MPs: Dubai, Dubai, Dubai, Dubai as the president lists "our sister countries" that we support.And DA leader Mmusi&nbsp;Maimane&rsquo;s failed trip to Zambia, which saw him being deported back to South Africa, ensured that he got his share of attention. "Zambia!&rdquo; yelled the ANC members of Parliament when the DA leader stepped up to the podium. "Zambia!" yells the ANC when DA leader @MmusiMaimane steps up to the NA's podium. #Zuma @News24 pic.twitter.com/YbtVJFe6R6Deputy minister for national planning and monitoring in the Presidency, Buti Manamela, quipped that Maimane had &ldquo;polished and multiple English accents&rdquo;.As Maimane listed the &ldquo;missed opportunities&rdquo; that could have seen the ANC remove Zuma from his position, ANC MPs heckled him, asking him about Helen Zille, who caused a stir with controversial tweets about colonialism. Many people believed she should be disciplined for her comments. As Maimane lists the "missed opportunities" the ANC could have removed President Zuma; ANC MPs heckle him with: "Zille" "what about Zille?"Some MPs, like Sisulu were prepared for a drop in blood sugar:Lindiwe Sisulu brought a slab chocolate, as always @News24 pic.twitter.com/TTW8lyAPlOAnother MP who received a special mention from journalists covering the event was Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini, who not only pitched up, but arrived only 45 minutes late.
