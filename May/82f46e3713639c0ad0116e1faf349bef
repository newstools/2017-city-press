The Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane is expected to lay a string of charges against President Jacob Zuma today. &ldquo;Today, May 30 2017, Democratic Alliance leader, Mmusi Maimane MP, and DA shadow minister of justice, Glynnis Breytenbach MP, will lay an array of criminal charges against President Zuma, members of the Gupta family, several cabinet ministers and senior executives of state-owned entities, and other individuals implicated in the ANC&rsquo;s corrupt state capture project,&rdquo; the DA said in a statement this morning. The charges will be laid at the Cape Town Police Station at 11am. The charges come after last weekend&rsquo;s reports by City Press exposed a trail of emails which were exchanged between Zuma and the Guptas, implicating them in capturing the state. The emails show how the Gupta family managed to &ldquo;seduce&rdquo; senior government officials as they took control of government and state-owned entities. &ldquo;The new state capture allegations, which emerged this past weekend, show the extent of the rot within the government, as multiple cabinet ministers, public officials and the upper leadership of state-owned entities have been implicated in a criminal syndicate to control the resources of our country, for their own selfish benefit,&rdquo; the DA said. Acting spokesperson Graham Charters would not divulge any of the charges but told City Press that the list of charges was long.
