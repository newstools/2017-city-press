The South African National Parks will be sending a chopper as soon as the fog lifts to locate five lions that have escaped from the Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga.The lions were last spotted on the crossing of the N4 free way and Mananga road near Komatipoort yesterday morning.SANParks spokesperson Rey Thakhuli said that rangers suspected they might have split up due to disturbances by people and were roaming in the sugarcane fields in the area.&ldquo;It has been difficult to move in because of the thick fog in the area, but once it is clear we will send a chopper and a vet to dart the animals,&rdquo; Thakhuli said.He warned people not to take photos of the lions as they were dangerous. &ldquo;We urge people to refrain from taking photographs of these animals as they are dangerous predators &hellip; and believed to have already killed a cow,&rdquo; said Thakhuli. Thakhuli said the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency was leading the search with support from SANParks and the police.He said anyone who sees the lions should report to authorities on 0800 10111, 076 801 9679 or 013 735 0197.
