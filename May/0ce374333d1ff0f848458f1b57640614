We are saying to the families we have done everything possible&hellip; normally the process takes three months,&rdquo; Lesufi said. The MEC added that a tombstone in memory of the 18 pupils would be put up in two schools and that the funeral costs &ndash; including support to the families &ndash; had been covered by government.&ldquo;It is abnormal to lose 20 people at the same time. It is a national disaster,&rdquo; Lesufi said.He said that 16 learners will be buried in a mass funeral on Saturday in Verena, and on Sunday one will be buried in KwaZulu-Natal and one in Limpopo. Another memorial service will be held in Verena in Mpumalanga on Thursday.The driver of the taxi, who also died in the crash, was laid to rest over the weekend.
